### Summary

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to using Unity's ML-Agents toolkit for reinforcement learning, focusing on training agents in different environments. It begins by configuring the VisualHallwayLearning brain in Unity to accept visual observations at a resolution of 84x84 pixels, ensuring the Vector Observation space size is set to 0. The process involves saving changes and running a training command in the ML-Agents directory using Python or Anaconda.

The VisualHallway example highlights a scenario where the agent fails to learn, serving as a challenge to better understand reinforcement learning. The guide suggests reverting to simpler examples, like the Hallway scene, to reaffirm understanding. The Hallway example uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and involves disabling extra training environments for simplicity. The agent's brain is set to HallwayLearning, and the training is observed for learning activity, measured by rewards.

Understanding state is crucial, as demonstrated by modifying the Hallway input state. The agent collects observations using vector inputs, and by reducing the input state (narrowing the agent's vision), training efficiency improves. This reduction in input space allows quicker training due to fewer paths to explore.

The guide then explores reducing visual state complexity in the VisualHallway example by adjusting the visual observation input to 32x32 grayscale, significantly reducing the input size. Despite this reduction, the agent still struggles to learn, illustrating the challenges of smaller visual states.

To enhance learning, convolutional layers are added to the ML-Agents training code. The process involves editing the `models.py` file to include an additional convolutional layer, which helps the agent extract finer details from the environment. This modification leads to more graceful agent movements, although training time increases.

The guide also touches on the concept of pooling, which can help retain spatial relationships in data. By adding a pooling layer in the CNN architecture, training performance may improve, despite longer training times. The overall approach emphasizes iterative experimentation with state and model configurations to optimize agent learning in complex environments.




In this text, the focus is on training agents using Unity's ML-Agents toolkit, exploring convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and optimizing hyperparameters for improved performance.

### Convolutional Networks and Pooling

The text begins with a discussion on convolutional networks, highlighting the use of pooling to extract high-level features such as the sky, walls, or floors. Pooling reduces spatial information, enabling quicker training but sometimes at the cost of performance. The balance between training speed and agent performance depends on the environment's visuals and the agent's required performance level.

### Recurrent Networks and Memory

Recurrent networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, are introduced as a method for agents to remember sequences of events. This memory is crucial for associating sequences with rewards. The DQRN (Deep Q Recurrent Network) architecture is mentioned, which incorporates LSTM layers to enhance training by remembering beneficial sequences.

### Disabling Recurrent Networks

The process of disabling recurrent networks is detailed, showing the impact on agent performance. Without recurrent networks, agents perform worse, as they cannot capture important sequences. This highlights the importance of memory in environments with repetitive patterns but also notes that some environments may not benefit from state sequencing.

### Tuning Hyperparameters

The text discusses the importance of tuning hyperparameters like `sequence_length` and `memory_size` in recurrent networks. These parameters affect how much information the agent can remember, influencing training performance. Adjusting these parameters can significantly enhance agent coordination and performance.

### Exercises and Practical Applications

Several exercises are provided to deepen understanding, such as exploring different environments, modifying sensor inputs, and experimenting with CNN architectures. These exercises encourage hands-on learning to improve agent training and performance.

### Summary

The chapter emphasizes the importance of controlling an agent's perception of its environment and balancing input/state. It covers modifying CNN architectures, the role of memory in training, and the impact of recurrent networks on performance. The next chapter promises to delve into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its role in reinforcement learning (RL), highlighting the importance of hyperparameters.

The exercise shows how continuous actions and vector observations are used, emphasizing the importance of observing inputs like direction, position, and body orientation.

Overall, the chapter provides a comprehensive guide to enhancing agent training through convolutional and recurrent networks, hyperparameter tuning, and practical exercises in Unity's ML-Agents toolkit.



# Summary of Reinforcement Learning Concepts

## Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Partially Observable MDP (POMDP)

- **MDP**: Defines the state/model an agent uses to calculate actions/values. In simpler environments, agents can map every state, but in complex environments, this becomes partially observable.
- **POMDP**: Agents have limited environmental visibility and learn actions based on a general policy. It's an off-model or policy-based method, suitable for environments with unknown/infinite observable states.

## Model-Free Methods

- Use experience buffers defined by hyperparameters like `time_horizon`, `batch_size`, and `buffer_size` to learn policies.
  - **time_horizon**: Steps of experience collected before adding to the buffer, balancing bias and variance.
  - **buffer_size**: Number of experiences collected before model updates.
  - **batch_size**: Experiences used per gradient descent update.

## Actor-Critic Model

- Solves continuous action space problems using neural networks.
- **Actor** selects actions from policy; **Critic** evaluates the action's value.
- Requires additional network layers and neurons for effective training in complex environments.

## Network Architecture

- Modifying network size affects training stability and performance. Smaller networks train faster but may hit performance walls.
- Larger networks offer fine control but require more training time.

## Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

- **TRPO**: Uses quadratic methods and trust regions to ensure safe, gradual learning progressions.
- **PPO**: Addresses TRPO's complexity by clipping the KL divergence between policies to limit policy changes per iteration.

## Hyperparameters

- **num_layers**: Hidden layers after observation input; more layers needed for complex problems.
- **hidden_units**: Units in each neural network layer; larger for complex interactions.
- **beta and epsilon**: Control clipping of policy changes in PPO, ensuring stable training.

These concepts form the foundation for understanding and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly in environments with complex or continuous action spaces. The balance between network complexity and training stability is crucial for optimizing agent performance. 



In reinforcement learning (RL), tuning hyperparameters is crucial for optimizing training performance. Two key parameters in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are beta and epsilon. Beta controls the strength of entropy regularization, influencing the randomness of policy actions. Adjusting beta ensures agents explore the action space effectively. If entropy decreases too quickly, beta should be increased; if too slowly, decreased. The typical range for beta is 1e-4 to 1e-2. Epsilon sets the acceptable divergence threshold between old and new policies during updates. Smaller values stabilize updates but slow training, with a typical range of 0.1 to 0.3.

In practice, modifying these parameters can impact training stability. For example, increasing beta and epsilon can lead to less stable training, as observed in the CrawlerDynamic scene exercise. The Unity ML-Agents framework provides a robust environment for experimenting with these settings.

Another parameter, lambda, recently added by Unity, is used in Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). Lambda balances reliance on current value estimates versus actual rewards. Lower values lead to high bias, while higher values increase variance. The optimal range is 0.9 to 0.95. Adjusting lambda affects training stability, as seen in the Walker example, where increasing lambda slowed training by 25%.

In addition to parameter tuning, modifying the environment can enhance learning. In the Reacher scene, adding joints and configuring their interactions allows for more complex agent behaviors. This involves changes in Unity's C# scripts, such as adding observations and actions for new joints, demonstrating how physics components like Rigidbody can be utilized for realistic simulations.

Multiple agent policies can further improve training. By training several agents on the same policy, the PPO method can be enhanced. This approach was explored in the Hallway/VisualHallway scene, where multiple agents were activated to train simultaneously. Adjusting parameters like num_epoch and batch_size in these scenarios can significantly impact training efficiency. Larger batch sizes and epochs are generally beneficial for continuous action samples, but their effects in discrete action environments with multiple agents are worth exploring.

In summary, RL training involves careful tuning of hyperparameters like beta, epsilon, and lambda, along with strategic environment modifications. Unity ML-Agents provides a flexible platform for experimenting with these variables, allowing developers to optimize training processes for various RL tasks.

### Summary

The text discusses various advanced techniques in reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on Curriculum Learning and Curiosity Learning within Unity's ML-Agents framework.

#### Curriculum Learning and Backplay

Curriculum Learning involves gradually increasing the difficulty of tasks to improve learning efficiency. The text outlines an example using "wall-jump" training, where parameters like `small_wall_height` are incrementally adjusted across lessons. A specialized form of Curriculum Learning, called Backplay, is introduced. Backplay starts the agent near the goal and progressively moves it back, facilitating learning in environments with sparse rewards. An example is provided with the VisualHallway scene, where the agent's starting position is adjusted using reset parameters to demonstrate Backplay.

#### Implementing Backplay

The implementation involves creating a JSON configuration file, `VisualHallwayLearning.json`, which sets reward thresholds and distance parameters to control agent progression. The file defines a curriculum to train agents by moving them incrementally further from the goal as they achieve certain reward thresholds. This approach is described as more of an innovative example rather than a true Backplay, which typically involves starting directly at the goal.

#### Curiosity Learning

Curiosity Learning introduces intrinsic motivation, allowing agents to explore environments based on internal rewards. This is modeled using the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), which uses neural networks to predict actions between states and calculates surprise as an intrinsic reward. Unity's implementation of ICM is detailed, with reference to a foundational paper by researchers at UC Berkeley.

#### Practical Application

The text provides a practical exercise using the Pyramid scene in Unity. Here, agents are tasked with solving a puzzle involving activating switches and retrieving a gold box, demonstrating the utility of Curiosity Learning. The exercise involves setting up the environment, enabling the curiosity module, and observing the agent's exploratory behavior.

#### Combining Techniques

The text suggests combining Backplay with Curiosity Learning in the Hallway scene to enhance training. This involves configuring the trainer with curiosity parameters and enabling Curriculum Learning to simulate Backplay. The exercise demonstrates the potential of combining extrinsic and intrinsic rewards for more effective reinforcement learning.

#### Conclusion

The document emphasizes the potential of Motivated Reinforcement Learning, which combines intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, to advance the field of deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

**Curiosity Learning** is applied to examples like VisualPyramids. This approach focuses on intrinsic rewards, motivating the agent to explore and learn beyond extrinsic rewards. The impact of disabling curiosity learning is also examined to understand its significance in agent training.

The text transitions to **Imitation and Transfer Learning**, highlighting the success of AlphaStar, an AI that used imitation learning to defeat a human player in StarCraft II. Imitation Learning (IL), or behavioral cloning, involves capturing human or AI actions to train agents. This can be done through online training, where agents learn in real-time, or offline training, using recorded gameplay.

In online IL, the agent learns by observing a player or another agent in real-time, which is engaging and effective. The Tennis example demonstrates this by allowing an agent to learn from a human-controlled player. However, IL is limited by the observations it receives and might not explore beyond the demonstrated actions.

Offline IL uses recorded gameplay to train agents, providing the flexibility to train multiple agents simultaneously. This method is particularly useful for complex scenarios, allowing agents to learn from high-quality demonstrations without the need for real-time interaction.

**Transfer Learning (TL)** is discussed as a broader category encompassing IL. TL involves transferring knowledge from one task or agent to another, which can include sharing weights or experiences. This approach is crucial for generalizing learning across different tasks and environments.

Overall, these advanced techniques in RL, including curriculum learning, backplay, curiosity learning, imitation learning, and transfer learning, offer powerful tools for developing intelligent agents. They enhance the training process by introducing structured learning paths, leveraging intrinsic motivations, and utilizing human-like learning strategies. These methods pave the way for more efficient and effective RL applications in various domains.



## Summary

The text focuses on training AI agents using Unity's ML-Agents toolkit, emphasizing imitation and transfer learning techniques.

1. **Example with Tennis**: In the TennisIL scene, a demonstration is recorded and used to train agents, showing how IL can be combined with transfer learning to improve agent performance.

2. **Training Multiple Agents**: Using recorded demonstrations, multiple agents are trained simultaneously, feeding back into a single policy. This method enhances the agents' capabilities quickly.

### Exercises and Exploration

The chapter concludes with exercises to practice setting up different scenes for IL and transfer learning. These exercises encourage experimenting with various environments and configurations to deepen understanding.

### Summary and Next Steps

The chapter summarizes key concepts of IL and transfer learning, highlighting their potential in developing adaptive AI strategies. It sets the stage for exploring multi-agent environments, where agents can engage in adversarial or cooperative self-play, offering new opportunities for AI training and development.

The following chapter will delve into multi-agent environments, exploring adversarial and cooperative self-play, and the use of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to enhance individuality in AI agents.



### Multi-Agent Environments: Overview

Chapter 11 of the text focuses on building and training multi-agent environments using Unity's ML-Agents framework. The chapter provides insights into cooperative and competitive self-play, using a soccer simulation as the primary example.

### SoccerTwos Environment

In the SoccerTwos environment, four agents are controlled by two brains: strikers aim to score goals while goalies attempt to block them. Each agent receives rewards based on performance, with the reward functions designed to encourage both cooperation and competition. For example, scoring a goal rewards the striker and penalizes the opposing goalie.

### Training Configuration

Training involves setting parameters in the `trainer_config.yaml` file for both striker and goalie learning. Key parameters include `max_steps`, `learning_rate`, `batch_size`, and `hidden_units`. The training process is initiated using the `mlagents-learn` command, and agents are trained to balance their rewards to achieve optimal performance.

### Conclusion

Overall, the chapter illustrates the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-agent systems, showcasing how agents can learn to cooperate and compete. The use of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, along with the ability to customize environments with assets, highlights the flexibility and potential of ML-Agents for developing sophisticated AI behaviors in gaming and beyond.



In this chapter, we explore creating unique agent behaviors in multi-agent environments by customizing extrinsic reward functions. We aim to enhance the entertainment value of a game by modifying agents' rewards based on personality traits. For example, we adjust rewards for different characters: the girl receives a 1.25x reward, the boy 0.95x, the policeman remains constant, and the zombie receives 0.5x.

To implement this, we modify Unity's C# scripts. We introduce a new `PersonRole` enum and add it to the agent's properties. This involves updating the `InitializeAgent` method and the `PlayerState` class to include the new role. We then modify the `RewardOrPunishPlayer` method to incorporate a new function, `RewardOrPunishPerson`, which applies the customized rewards based on the agent's personality.

After setting up the code, we assign personalities to agents in Unity, such as RedStriker as a girl or BlueGoalie as a policeman. We save the changes and update the configuration files to reflect these new roles. Training begins using the `mlagents-learn` command, and we observe the agents' interactions.

Despite the initial setup, the training results on TensorBoard indicate minimal policy change, suggesting a need for further refinement. We could enhance training by adding more observations or using non-linear reward functions. The chapter concludes with exercises to deepen understanding, such as modifying reward functions with exponential or logarithmic transformations and adapting the setup to different scenes or characters.

Overall, this chapter demonstrates the potential of using extrinsic rewards to model agent personalities and influence behavior in multi-agent environments, paving the way for more complex and entertaining game dynamics.

In the next chapter, we will explore using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for debugging and testing games. This involves setting up ML-Agents to automate testing processes, providing insights into game performance and potential issues. We will cover steps such as setting up ML-Agents, overriding Unity's input system, and analyzing the testing process. This approach aims to streamline game development by integrating AI-driven testing, offering a robust tool for quality assurance in game design.



In the process of debugging and testing a game with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), setting up a goal for the agent to explore is crucial. This involves creating challenging locations within the game level that the agent must find, encouraging extensive exploration and providing a map of frequently visited areas. In this context, ML-Agents, a tool developed by Unity, is used to facilitate the integration of machine learning into the game environment.

### Setting Up ML-Agents

ML-Agents is currently available as a GitHub project and needs to be exported as an asset package for use in Unity. The setup involves opening a Unity Editor session, selecting the ML-Agents folder, and exporting it without dependencies. This package is then imported into a new test project. New folders such as `Brains`, `Prefabs`, and `Scripts` are created to organize the project structure.

### Introducing Rewards

In open-world games, defining clear goals and rewards is essential for the agent's learning process. A simple reward function is established where the agent scores a reward of 1 upon encountering a goal. Additionally, a step reward of -1 divided by the maximum number of steps is introduced to encourage efficiency. The goal is to develop a generic system that can be applied to various game environments.

### Building the TestingAcademy

A new object, `TestingAcademy`, is created to manage goal deployment. This involves scripting in C#, using the ML-Agents namespace, and defining variables for goal deployment. The `InitializeAcademy` method is crucial for setting up the agents and goals, while the `AcademyReset` method handles goal randomization within defined bounds.

### Setting Up the TestingAcademy

The `TestingAcademy` script is added to a game object, and a goal object is created with a Rigidbody component to enable physics interactions. This object is then converted into a Prefab for easy instantiation. Two brains, `TestingLearningBrain` and `TestingPlayerBrain`, are created to manage agent behavior.

### Scripting the TestingAgent

The `TestingAgent` script is developed to enable the agent to interact with the environment. It involves defining methods such as `InitializeAgent`, `CollectObservations`, and `AgentAction`. These methods manage agent initialization, environmental observations, and actions, respectively. The `MoveAgent` function processes the agent's movements based on brain inputs.

### Setting Up the TestingAgent

The `TestingAgent` script is applied to a vehicle object, enabling it to act as the agent. A specific camera view is selected for visual observations. Key properties such as `Brain`, `Camera`, and `Axis Action` are configured to control agent behavior. The setup is designed to be adaptable for various environments.

### Overriding the Unity Input System

Unity's input system allows for cross-platform compatibility. To integrate ML-Agents effectively, the game's input system must follow Unity's best practices. This involves using abstraction layers to inject custom code, ensuring seamless interaction between the agent and the game environment.

This comprehensive setup of ML-Agents in Unity provides a foundation for using DRL to test and debug games, facilitating the development of intelligent agents capable of exploring and learning within complex environments.



In the context of game development using Unity and ML-Agents, this text provides a detailed guide on configuring input systems, implementing a Singleton pattern, and setting up testing and learning environments for deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

### Input System Configuration

The input system in Unity is configured through the Input tab in Project Settings, where Horizontal and Vertical axes are defined. These axes translate discrete inputs, like keystrokes, into continuous values ranging from -1 to +1. This allows for platform-independent input control, facilitating seamless integration across different devices.

### Singleton Pattern

A Singleton pattern is implemented to create a class accessible throughout the codebase, ensuring thread safety and preventing memory issues. The Singleton class is defined in C# using UnityEngine and MonoBehaviour. It provides a static instance that persists across scenes, allowing consistent input handling.

csharp
public class Singleton<T> : MonoBehaviour where T : MonoBehaviour {
    private static T m_Instance;
    public static T Instance {
        get {
            if (m_Instance == null) {
                m_Instance = (T)FindObjectOfType(typeof(T));
                if (m_Instance == null) {
                    var singletonObject = new GameObject();
                    m_Instance = singletonObject.AddComponent<T>();
                    DontDestroyOnLoad(singletonObject);
                }
            }
            return m_Instance;
        }
    }
}


### TestingInput Script

The `TestingInput` script extends the Singleton class and manages input axes through a dictionary. This allows for overriding specific inputs during testing.

csharp
public class TestingInput : Singleton<TestingInput> {
    public string[] axes;
    public bool isPlayer;
    private Dictionary<string, float> axisValues;

    void Start() {
        axisValues = new Dictionary<string, float>();
        foreach(var axis in axes) {
            axisValues.Add(axis, 0);
        }
    }

    public void setAxis(float value, string axisName) {
        if (!isPlayer && axes.Contains(axisName)) {
            axisValues[axisName] = value;
        }
    }

    public float getAxis(string axisName) {
        return isPlayer ? Input.GetAxis(axisName) : axisValues.GetValueOrDefault(axisName, 0);
    }
}


### Scene Integration

The `TestingInput` component is added to the scene to manage input overrides. This involves creating an empty GameObject and attaching the script to it, allowing for specific axis overrides like Vertical and Horizontal.

### Overriding Game Input

The game input is overridden by modifying the script where input axes are queried. The `TestingInput.Instance.getAxis` method is used to retrieve the current input values, ensuring the game responds to the overridden inputs.

csharp
verticalInput = TestingInput.Instance.getAxis(_verticalInput);
horizontalInput = TestingInput.Instance.getAxis(_horizontalInput);


### Configuring Brains

Brains in ML-Agents are configured to handle input and observation spaces. The `TestingPlayerBrain` and `TestingLearningBrain` are set up with parameters for visual observations and continuous actions, enabling the agent to learn and play the game effectively.

### Training and Imitation Learning

Training involves setting up a configuration file for ML-Agents, specifying hyperparameters for continuous action problems. Imitation learning is facilitated by recording player actions and using these demonstrations to train agents. This approach allows for guided testing and learning, improving the agent's ability to achieve goals efficiently.

### Conclusion

This comprehensive setup allows for effective testing and training of game agents using Unity and ML-Agents, leveraging advanced input handling, Singleton patterns, and imitation learning to enhance game development and testing processes.



The text explores debugging and testing games using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Unity ML-Agents. It emphasizes the importance of early implementation for identifying bugs and suggests adding analytics to track agent activities. The current ML-Agents lack comprehensive training analytics, which can be supplemented using Unity Analytics. This involves setting up analytics in Unity, enabling services, and configuring custom analytics to track game events.

To implement custom analytics, a C# script, `TestingAnalytics`, is created to collect data on agent distances to goals. This script is integrated into the Unity scene as a prefab, allowing for consistent tracking across different game objects.
