The book also addresses secure user experience practices, threat modeling, and reviewing code for security vulnerabilities.

Hoffman's work is praised for its structured approach, making complex security concepts accessible. The book includes advanced content on new technologies like GraphQL, cloud-based deployments, and content delivery networks, offering strategies for threat modeling and zero trust architecture. This edition serves as an essential resource for software developers and security professionals aiming to enhance their understanding and implementation of web application security.



### Security Automation and Analysis

Security automation involves static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities. Static analysis examines code without execution, while dynamic analysis tests during runtime. Vulnerability regression testing ensures that previously identified issues are fixed. Responsible disclosure and bug bounty programs incentivize external reporting of vulnerabilities. Third-party penetration testing provides an external evaluation of security.

### Vulnerability Management

Reproducing vulnerabilities and ranking their severity is crucial. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is used for this purpose, consisting of base, temporal, and environmental scoring. Advanced scoring goes beyond basic triage to provide a comprehensive assessment.

### Defending Against XSS Attacks

Anti-XSS practices include sanitizing user input, using DOMParser, and encoding HTML entities. Content Security Policy (CSP) helps prevent XSS by controlling script sources and mitigating unsafe evals.

### Defending Against CSRF Attacks

Header verification and CSRF tokens are essential. Stateless GET requests and application-wide CSRF mitigation strategies enhance security.

### Defending Against XXE and Injection

Evaluating data formats and understanding advanced XXE risks are necessary. SQL injection is mitigated through prepared statements and database-specific defenses. The principle of least authority and allowlisting commands are key strategies.

### Defending Against DoS Attacks

Protection against Regex DoS, logical DoS, and DDoS is critical. Strategies involve identifying potential attack vectors and implementing robust defenses.

### Defending Data and Objects

Mass assignment and serialization attacks are mitigated through validation, allowlisting, and secure data transfer objects. IDOR defenses are also necessary.

### Defense Against Client-Side Attacks

Prototype pollution and clickjacking are addressed through key sanitization, prototype freezing, and framebusting techniques. Tabnabbing is mitigated with cross-origin policies.

### Securing Third-Party Dependencies

Evaluating and modeling dependency trees is crucial for secure integration. Automated evaluation and secure package management are recommended practices.

### Mitigating Business Logic Vulnerabilities

Architecture-level mitigations involve statistical modeling and input analysis. Understanding model development and analysis enhances application security.

### Preface Insights

The book is updated with new content on technologies like GraphQL and NoSQL. It targets intermediate-level software engineers and web developers, focusing on both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques. JavaScript is used for examples due to its ubiquity in web development. The book emphasizes understanding concepts over relying on tools, aiming to provide long-lasting knowledge applicable across various technologies and roles.



The book is structured as a comprehensive guide for security professionals, including Security Engineers, Pen Testers, and Bug Bounty Hunters, offering insights into both hacking and securing web applications. It is divided into three main parts: Recon, Offense, and Defense, each focusing on different aspects of application-level security.

**Recon:** This section emphasizes gathering information about web applications without hacking them. It highlights the importance of reconnaissance skills in differentiating great hackers from good ones. Reconnaissance helps in prioritizing exploits and is crucial for black box testing, where the tester has no prior knowledge of the application's structure.

**Offense:** The book transitions to analyzing code and network requests to exploit insecurely written or configured applications. It covers various hacking techniques used by malicious hackers, emphasizing ethical usage. Each chapter in this part details a specific exploit, starting with its mechanics, identifying vulnerabilities, crafting payloads, and deploying them. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one example discussed, showcasing how malicious code can be executed on another user's machine due to poor filtration mechanisms.

**Defense:** This section focuses on securing code against hackers, revisiting the exploits covered in the Offense section with a defensive perspective. It teaches how to protect against specific exploits and implement general protections through secure coding practices. The section also discusses the trade-offs between security measures and application performance, usability, and maintenance. For instance, generic error messages can enhance security but may reduce usability.

The book stresses the importance of understanding both offensive and defensive strategies to architect secure systems. It also highlights the need for a common language and terminology to effectively communicate security concepts. The book is designed to be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their security skills or transition into a security engineering role, providing a well-rounded perspective on the complexities of web application security.



**Penetration Testing and Security Roles**

Penetration testers are professionals hired to identify vulnerabilities in systems, similar to hackers but with permission to report and help fix these issues. Bug bounty hunters are freelance penetration testers who participate in responsible disclosure programs for rewards. Application security engineers focus on improving the security of an organization's codebase, while software security engineers develop security-related products. System administrators maintain server configurations and uptime, and scrum masters help engineering teams plan and execute development work. Security champions are engineers interested in enhancing security without being directly responsible for it.

**Security Terms and Concepts**

A vulnerability is a bug that allows unintended actions against a system. Threat vectors are insecure application sections likely containing vulnerabilities. The attack surface is a list of vulnerabilities a hacker might exploit. Exploits are code blocks used to take advantage of vulnerabilities, and payloads are formatted exploits sent to servers.

**Security Teams**

Red teams, composed of penetration testers and security engineers, simulate attacks to test a company's defenses. Blue teams, made up of security engineers, work on improving security using feedback from red teams. Purple teams combine red and blue team roles, requiring a broad skill set.

**Web and Application Types**

Websites are information documents accessible via the internet, while web applications are browser-based applications with various permissions and user interactions. Hybrid applications are mobile apps built on web technologies.

**Acronyms and Protocols**

- **API**: Interfaces for code modules to interact, often over HTTP.
- **CSRF**: Cross-Site Request Forgery exploits user permissions.
- **DDoS/DoS**: Attacks overwhelming servers with requests.

The text explores the evolution of cryptography and hacking, starting with the Enigma machine during World War II. The Enigma machine, used by the Axis Powers, was a pivotal development in secure communications. Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and his team reverse-engineered the machine by analyzing patterns in encrypted messages, laying the groundwork for modern hacking techniques.

As the complexity of Enigma encryption increased, Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park developed the bombe, an automated device to decrypt Enigma messages. Turing's approach, known as a known plaintext attack, marked one of the first automated hacking tools, revolutionizing cryptography.

The text then shifts to the 1950s with the rise of telephone networks and the emergence of "phreaking." Phreakers exploited tone dialing systems, notably using a 2600 Hz tone to manipulate calls. This led to the development of blue boxes, devices that automated these exploits. The telecom industry responded with dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signaling, a more secure system that used two frequencies per keypress, making it harder to exploit.

The narrative progresses to the 1980s, highlighting the introduction of personal computers like the Apple 1 and Commodore 64. This era saw the birth of computer viruses, with Fred Cohen creating the first self-replicating virus, illustrating the challenges in distinguishing malicious software from legitimate programs. This period marked the beginning of widespread computer use and the need for robust software security measures.

Overall, the text traces the historical developments in cryptography and hacking, emphasizing the continuous evolution of security technologies and the persistent challenge of protecting digital communications from innovative hacking techniques.



The Morris Worm, released in 1988, marked a pivotal moment in cybersecurity history as it infected approximately 15,000 computers, leading to the first US government regulations against hacking. This incident highlighted the vulnerabilities in early computer systems. Over time, hackers shifted focus from operating systems to web browsers, exploiting techniques like scalability and camouflaging. Modern attacks often involve phishing and malicious browser plug-ins, targeting users through email, social media, and legitimate-looking websites.

The rise of the World Wide Web in the 1990s and early 2000s transformed the internet from a document-sharing platform to an application distribution platform, known as Web 2.0. This shift enabled user interaction and data sharing, birthing social media, blogs, and more. However, it also introduced new vulnerabilities. Early web applications lacked security controls, making them susceptible to attacks like denial of service (DoS) and cross-site scripting (XSS). Hackers exploited these weaknesses, targeting user data and credentials.

By the 2010s, hackers adapted to the evolving web landscape, focusing on exploiting web applications rather than servers or networks. Modern web applications, often complex with numerous dependencies, present new opportunities for exploitation. Hackers now primarily target logical vulnerabilities in application code rather than browser or network flaws. This shift underscores the importance of robust security measures and the need for continuous adaptation in cybersecurity practices.

Today's web browsers are equipped with advanced security features like the Same Origin Policy (SOP) and Content Security Policy (CSP), which help mitigate risks. Protocols such as SSL and TLS enhance data encryption, reducing the likelihood of successful man-in-the-middle attacks. Despite these advancements, web applications remain complex, with many open-source dependencies, integrations, and databases, making them prime targets for hackers.

The cyclical nature of cybersecurity is evident as new technologies emerge, each with unique vulnerabilities. As web applications become more secure, hackers will likely shift focus to new attack surfaces, such as real-time communication or WebSockets. Staying informed about the latest technologies and potential security holes is crucial for both hackers and security professionals.

Web application reconnaissance is a critical phase in understanding and exploiting web applications. It involves gathering detailed information about a target application, including its technical and functional aspects. This knowledge aids in identifying valuable data and functionality, allowing for more targeted and effective attacks. Reconnaissance is essential for both offensive and defensive security strategies, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and weak security mechanisms.

In summary, the evolution of hacking from operating systems to web applications reflects the broader changes in technology and security practices. As hackers adapt to new environments, the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in cybersecurity becomes paramount. Understanding the intricacies of web applications and staying abreast of emerging technologies are key to maintaining robust security in an ever-evolving digital landscape.



Reconnaissance techniques are critical for understanding web applications' technology and structure. These techniques should only be applied to applications you own or have permission to test, as unauthorized use can lead to legal issues. Recon involves navigating web apps to understand their functionality, but not all apps provide a full user interface. For example, banking apps typically offer limited access to customers, while internal staff have broader permissions. This illustrates role-based access control (RBAC), where permissions vary based on user roles.

Web application mapping is the process of creating a detailed representation of an app's structure and functionality. This is essential before attempting any security testing. Effective mapping involves documenting APIs, network structures, and user permissions. JSON-like formats are often used for their hierarchical nature, which mirrors the structure of web applications. Tools like Notion or XMind can aid in organizing this information.

Modern web applications differ significantly from those a decade ago, often using technologies like REST APIs, JavaScript frameworks (e.g., ReactJS, AngularJS), and various databases. These apps are typically composed of multiple interconnected applications rather than a single monolithic structure. REST APIs, a common architectural pattern, are stateless, separate from the client, and easily cacheable. They use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to define actions, making them scalable and easy to document with tools like Swagger.

Understanding these technologies is crucial for effective reconnaissance and security testing. Modern web applications often involve complex interactions between client-side applications, multiple servers, and databases, requiring a comprehensive approach to mapping and testing. As the landscape of web technologies continues to evolve, staying informed about new developments and security implications is essential for both exploiting and securing web applications.



In modern web applications, RESTful APIs are prevalent, often utilizing JSON for data exchange due to its lightweight, human-readable, and hierarchical structure. JSON's similarity to JavaScript objects facilitates easy parsing and object creation in browsers, which natively support JSON parsing. This makes JSON an efficient format for client-server communication in stateless environments.

JavaScript, the primary language for client-side scripting, is used extensively in web applications. It supports dynamic programming and is integral to interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM). JavaScript variables can be defined using `var`, `let`, or `const`, each with different scoping rules. `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped, with `const` also preventing reassignment. These distinctions are crucial for avoiding bugs and maintaining code readability.

Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, allowing them to be assigned to variables and passed as arguments. JavaScript supports various function types, including anonymous functions, named functions, and immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE). Context in JavaScript functions, accessed via `this`, can be complex and is often managed using methods like `bind`, `call`, and `apply` to transfer context between functions. Arrow functions provide a simpler syntax, inheriting context from their parent scope.

JavaScript's prototypal inheritance differs from class-based inheritance in other languages. Objects in JavaScript have a `prototype` property, enabling inheritance. Modifications to a prototype can propagate to all derived objects, offering flexibility but also potential for runtime changes and vulnerabilities like Prototype Pollution.

Asynchronous programming is essential in web development to handle non-uniform response times in client-server communication. JavaScript provides mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax to manage asynchronous operations, allowing code to continue executing while waiting for operations like network requests to complete.

Understanding these JavaScript and JSON fundamentals is crucial for developing, debugging, and securing modern web applications, as they form the backbone of client-server interactions and data handling. Mastery of these concepts enables efficient API usage and integration, crucial for tasks like penetration testing and reverse engineering web applications.



In asynchronous programming, functions may not resolve in the order they're called due to variable network request times. This model enhances performance by allowing simultaneous request initiation and handling resolutions as they occur. Initially, JavaScript used callbacks for this, which, while efficient, were hard to read and debug. Promises improved readability by chaining functions and handling errors more effectively. The latest approach, async functions, further simplifies asynchrony by turning functions into promises, using `await` to pause execution until a promise resolves.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial for managing state in web browsers, providing a hierarchical structure that JavaScript uses to interact with web pages. It's essential for JavaScript developers to understand the DOM to identify vulnerabilities at the presentation layer. SPA frameworks like ReactJS, EmberJS, VueJS, and AngularJS emerged to bridge the gap between websites and desktop applications, allowing complex applications with reusable components and internal state management.

Authentication and authorization are critical in web applications to ensure data access is restricted to the correct users. Authentication verifies user identity, while authorization determines resource access. Early systems like HTTP basic authentication were simple but flawed. Modern systems use protocols like OAuth for secure identity verification across platforms, often coupled with MFA for enhanced security.

Web servers like Apache, NGINX, and Microsoft IIS facilitate server-side application logic. Apache is widely used for its configurability, while NGINX offers performance benefits for high-volume applications. IIS is preferred for Microsoft-specific technologies. Server-side databases like SQL and NoSQL store user data, each with unique strengths and vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection risks.

Client-side data storage is evolving, with local storage and session storage allowing persistent state management across browser sessions. IndexedDB provides a more powerful storage option for complex applications by enabling asynchronous querying. Understanding these storage options is crucial for preventing exposure of sensitive data.

Overall, modern web applications rely on a combination of asynchronous programming, DOM management, SPA frameworks, robust authentication/authorization systems, efficient web servers, and secure data storage practices to deliver responsive and secure user experiences.



GraphQL, introduced in 2015, has become a popular method for querying API endpoints by wrapping existing APIs and allowing complex queries through its scripting language. This enables requests for specific fields, complex arguments, and operations, reducing network latency compared to traditional REST APIs. While GraphQL enhances query capabilities, it also introduces security concerns due to its complexity.

Version Control Systems (VCS), particularly Git, are essential in modern web application development. Git allows developers to manage code changes, create branches, and merge variations efficiently. GitHub and GitLab are popular platforms offering hosted Git services with easy-to-use APIs. A typical Git workflow involves initializing a repository, linking to a remote repository, creating a `.gitignore` file, staging changes, committing them, and pushing to the remote repository. CI/CD tools are often integrated with Git to automate testing and deployment, enhancing the development process but also introducing potential security vulnerabilities.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and caching are used in modern applications to offload static content, improving scalability and reducing server load. CDNs distribute content globally, enhancing performance but posing risks like stale caching. Client-side caching, including browser caches and local storage, adds complexity and potential security challenges due to synchronization issues.

Security in web applications now extends beyond the network stack to include VCS and CI/CD pipelines. Compromises in these areas can be catastrophic, necessitating a comprehensive security approach. Modern web applications use various technologies, increasing the attack surface compared to older applications. Security experts must possess software development skills to understand application architecture and identify vulnerabilities across client, server, and network layers.

Finding subdomains is crucial for scoping and testing API endpoints. Web applications often use multiple domains, and identifying these can reveal potential targets for penetration testing. Techniques include using browser network analysis tools to inspect API requests and leveraging public records and search engine caches to uncover hidden subdomains. Google search operators, such as `site:` and `-inurl:`, can refine searches to reveal subdomains and other valuable information.

Overall, modern web applications rely on advanced technologies and methodologies, offering enhanced functionality but also requiring robust security practices to mitigate the expanded range of vulnerabilities.



The text discusses techniques for discovering subdomains, focusing on methods like using search operators, public archives, social media APIs, DNS zone transfers, and brute force attacks.

### Search Operators
Using `-inurl:<pattern>` helps filter out known subdomains in search results, revealing less obvious ones. For example, using `site:reddit.com -inurl:www` can uncover subdomains like `code.reddit.com`. This technique is applicable across various search engines.

### Public Archives
Archive.org is valuable for historical data, offering snapshots of websites that may reveal past subdomains. Searching through archived HTML can uncover links that are no longer present in the live version of a site.

### Social Media APIs
APIs like Twitter's allow for data mining to discover subdomains mentioned in tweets. The Twitter API offers different tiers, with the free tier allowing limited searches. More comprehensive data requires higher-tier access. Queries can be structured to find mentions of specific domains, potentially revealing subdomains used in marketing or other campaigns.

### DNS Zone Transfers
A DNS zone transfer attack exploits improperly configured DNS servers to retrieve DNS records, potentially revealing hidden subdomains. This involves mimicking a DNS server and requesting a zone file. If successful, it provides a list of subdomains and their IP addresses.

### Brute Force Attacks
As a last resort, brute force can be used to discover subdomains by systematically testing potential subdomain names. This method is time-consuming and can be easily detected by servers, leading to IP bans. Efficient brute force requires asynchronous requests to minimize latency.

### Conclusion
These methods, from using search operators to brute force, offer various ways to uncover subdomains for reconnaissance. Each has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on factors like the complexity of the target's security and the need for historical data.



The text describes a method for generating and querying subdomains, focusing on brute force and dictionary attacks to discover potential subdomains of a domain. The process involves creating a script using Node.js and its DNS library to resolve these subdomains to IP addresses.

### Subdomain Generation

1. **Character Set**: The script starts by defining a character set (`a-z`) to generate subdomains. This can be expanded to include other characters like hyphens or non-Latin scripts.

2. **Algorithm Complexity**: The generation process has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the subdomain, and m is the number of characters.

3. **Combination Generation**: Subdomains are generated by iteratively appending each character in the charset to existing subdomains, creating all possible combinations up to a specified length.

### DNS Querying

1. **Asynchronous DNS Resolution**: Using Node.js’s `dns.resolve` function, the script asynchronously queries each generated subdomain against a given domain (e.g., `mega-bank.com`).

2. **Promises for Performance**: The script uses JavaScript promises to handle asynchronous DNS requests more efficiently than `dns.lookup`, which relies on synchronous system calls.

3. **Result Handling**: Once all queries are resolved, the script logs subdomains that resolve to an IP address.

### Combining Scripts

- The generation and querying scripts can be combined to automate the process of discovering valid subdomains.

### Dictionary Attacks

1. **Efficiency Over Brute Force**: Instead of generating all possible subdomains, dictionary attacks use a predefined list of common subdomains, significantly speeding up the process.

2. **dnscan Tool**: The text mentions `dnscan`, an open-source tool that provides lists of popular subdomains, which can be integrated into the script.

3. **Integration**: For large lists, subdomains should be read from a file rather than hardcoded, using Node.js’s file system and CSV parsing capabilities.

### Reconnaissance Strategy

- The ultimate goal is to map out an application’s infrastructure by identifying subdomains, which can reveal less scrutinized, potentially vulnerable areas like mail servers or admin panels.

### API Endpoint Analysis

1. **REST API Characteristics**: The text outlines how to recognize REST APIs by their hierarchical structure and stateless nature, often indicated by token-based authorization.

2. **HTTP Verbs**: Common HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are used to interact with API endpoints. The `OPTIONS` method can reveal supported verbs.

3. **Endpoint Discovery Script**: A script is provided to test endpoints with different HTTP verbs, checking for valid responses and potential vulnerabilities.

The text emphasizes the importance of using multiple techniques in reconnaissance to ensure comprehensive subdomain discovery and API analysis. It suggests starting with dictionary attacks for efficiency and employing brute force as a secondary measure. The goal is to gather intelligence on application servers to identify potential security weaknesses.



In API analysis, determining the existence and functionality of endpoints is crucial. This involves making HTTP requests with various verbs and checking responses. If a server doesn’t respond within a set time (e.g., 1 second), a default value like -1 is returned. Authentication mechanisms are vital to understand, as many modern applications use tokens for secure communication. Common authentication schemes include HTTP Basic Auth, HTTP Digest Authentication, and OAuth. Each has strengths and weaknesses, such as ease of interception or susceptibility to phishing.

For example, HTTP Basic Auth sends a base64-encoded username:password string, which is insecure without SSL/TLS. OAuth, often used for integrations, enables tokenized permissions but poses phishing risks. Understanding these schemes helps in analyzing API endpoints requiring authentication.

Determining the payload shape for an API endpoint involves analyzing known requests or making educated guesses. Common endpoints like sign-in or password reset often have standardized payloads. For instance, OAuth 2.0 endpoints typically expect a payload with fields like response_type, client_id, and redirect_uri. However, application-specific endpoints may require trial and error to identify the correct payload shape, especially if error messages are vague. Techniques like using privileged accounts or brute-forcing with known constraints can help deduce these shapes.

Identifying third-party dependencies is crucial for security analysis, as vulnerabilities in these can be exploited. Client-side frameworks like EmberJS, Angular, React, and VueJS can be detected via global objects or specific attributes. For instance, EmberJS uses a global `Ember` object and tags DOM elements with `ember-id`. Angular uses an `ng-version` attribute in its root elements, while React and VueJS have global objects `React` and `Vue`, respectively.

Detecting JavaScript libraries involves checking for global namespaces like `_` for Lodash or `$` for JQuery. Scripts can be enumerated using the DOM’s `querySelectorAll` function to list all `<script>` tags. Similarly, CSS libraries can be detected by querying `<link>` elements with `rel="stylesheet"`.

Server-side framework detection is more challenging than client-side, as server dependencies don't manifest directly in the client’s environment. However, understanding the client-side setup provides insights into potential server-side configurations and dependencies.

In summary, analyzing APIs and identifying dependencies involves a combination of automated tools and manual techniques. Understanding common patterns and authentication mechanisms is essential for effective API analysis, while recognizing third-party dependencies highlights potential security risks. This approach aids in both securing applications and identifying vulnerabilities.



Detecting server-side frameworks and third-party dependencies in web applications is crucial for identifying potential security vulnerabilities. Many web servers expose critical information through headers, such as the `X-Powered-By` header, which can reveal the server's name and version. Although smart administrators disable these headers, many websites still expose them.

Frameworks like Ruby on Rails can be fingerprinted to determine their version by examining default error messages and 404 pages. By analyzing changes in the source code, testers can identify specific versions and associated vulnerabilities, such as the XSS vulnerability in Ruby on Rails versions 3.2.x to 4.2.7 (CVE-2016-6316).

Database detection is another aspect of identifying dependencies. Most web applications use server-side databases like MySQL or MongoDB. By analyzing primary key generation patterns, such as MongoDB's `ObjectId`, testers can infer the database type used by the application.

Understanding third-party integrations is essential for security assessments. Many vulnerabilities arise from these integrations, making it critical to be aware of the software and versions used. Proper documentation of technologies, API endpoints, and configurations aids in prioritizing security testing efforts.

Application architecture plays a significant role in security. Vulnerabilities often stem from weak architecture rather than poorly written code. Secure applications integrate security measures during development, while insecure ones may not implement any. For example, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by sanitizing data before DOM injection.

To secure applications, it's important to abstract security mechanisms into the architecture rather than implementing them on a case-by-case basis. For instance, using a function like `DOMPurify` to sanitize data before appending it to the DOM can significantly reduce XSS risks.

Overall, understanding and evaluating third-party dependencies and application architecture are essential skills for security professionals to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in web applications.



The text discusses the importance of secure application architecture, emphasizing multiple layers of security to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF. It highlights that applications are only as secure as their weakest link, and stresses the need for security mechanisms across various layers, such as API and database stages. The text warns against the risks of reinventing existing technologies, particularly in security-sensitive areas like cryptography. Reinventing can lead to significant security risks if not done with expertise.

The text also covers the importance of identifying insecure architecture, as it can lead to vulnerabilities. It suggests prioritizing areas with fewer security mechanisms when searching for vulnerabilities. The discussion extends to the mindset of developers and organizations, warning against the tendency to reinvent tools without considering security implications. It advises adopting well-tested solutions, especially in areas requiring deep expertise.

The text further explains the importance of recon in web application security, emphasizing the need to identify architectural flaws early. It suggests that effective recon techniques can help map out an application’s structure, identify weak points, and guide the search for vulnerabilities. The recon process should be documented and organized to facilitate automation and sharing within the security community.

In the latter part, the text introduces the hacker's mindset, focusing on the skills and mindset required for successful hacking. It describes how hackers analyze software to find entry points, often spending significant time without immediate success. The text underscores the need for continuous learning and adaptation in hacking, as old techniques may become obsolete.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of secure application architecture, the risks of reinventing technologies, the importance of recon in identifying vulnerabilities, and the mindset required for effective hacking.



In web application security, understanding API types is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities, particularly with REST APIs. Endpoint discovery and authentication scheme analysis are essential skills, as they help exploit code reuse across applications. Identifying third-party dependencies and their integration points can reveal security flaws, offering opportunities for exploits.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a prevalent vulnerability arising from increased user interaction in web applications. XSS attacks exploit the execution of scripts in users' browsers, with three main types identified by the OWASP: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-based XSS. Stored XSS involves malicious scripts stored in a database, affecting multiple users when the script is executed on their machines. These attacks are dangerous due to their potential to impact many users, but they are easier to detect since the scripts are stored server-side.

Reflected XSS, on the other hand, does not store the payload on the server. Instead, the server reflects the malicious script back to the client, executing it in the browser. This type of XSS can be harder to detect as it requires real-time interaction between the client and server.

An example of a stored XSS attack involves a user injecting a script tag into a comment on a customer support portal. When viewed by a support representative, the script executes, potentially stealing sensitive data. Such vulnerabilities arise from improper sanitization of user inputs, allowing scripts to be interpreted as DOM elements rather than text.

To mitigate XSS risks, developers should ensure proper sanitization of user inputs, implement Content Security Policies (CSP), and regularly scan databases for stored scripts. Despite these measures, advanced XSS payloads may still bypass defenses through encoding or complex concatenation, requiring continuous vigilance and updated security practices.

In summary, XSS attacks exploit unsanitized user inputs to execute unauthorized scripts in browsers, posing significant risks through data theft and account takeover. Understanding the types and mechanisms of XSS is vital for developing effective security strategies.



Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are categorized into stored, reflected, DOM-based, and mutation-based types. Stored XSS attacks are easily detectable as they are server-side, while reflected XSS is harder to detect since they are user-targeted and not stored in databases. Reflected XSS often involves crafting a malicious link sent directly to a user, which can be disguised as a legitimate link. For example, a link with an embedded script can execute code when clicked, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate users or access sensitive information.

DOM-based XSS, a subset of client-side XSS, uses browser DOM sinks and sources for execution without server interaction. This makes them difficult to detect with static analysis tools. These attacks require both a "source" (a DOM object storing text) and a "sink" (a DOM API executing a script). Browser and version differences complicate detection and reproduction of DOM XSS attacks. For example, a URL parameter or hash can be a source for DOM XSS, with a payload injected into the search query or hash. If another code body uses it improperly, script execution can occur.

Mutation-based XSS (mXSS) relies on browser optimizations and DOM mutations to bypass XSS filters. These attacks mutate safe payloads into unsafe ones after filtration. A notable example involved a Google library where a payload passed through a sanitization library but mutated into an executable script in the browser. mXSS can bypass robust filters like DOMPurify, and as browsers vary in implementation, server-side filtration is less effective.

To bypass filters, attackers exploit quirks such as self-closing HTML tags, protocol-relative URLs (PRURLs), malformed tags, encoding escapes, and polyglot payloads. Self-closing tags can bypass filters and be regenerated by browsers. PRURLs allow browsers to choose protocols, potentially bypassing filters. Malformed tags can pass filtration and execute after browsers correct them. Encoding escapes use alternate character representations like Unicode to bypass static analysis. Polyglot payloads execute in various browser contexts, saving time during testing.

Overall, XSS attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications by injecting malicious scripts, with each type having unique characteristics and challenges in detection and prevention. Despite advances in security measures, XSS remains a persistent threat due to the complexity and variability of web technologies.



Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are prevalent web vulnerabilities with significant implications. XSS exploits involve injecting scripts into web pages viewed by users. These exploits rely on "sinks" (methods capable of executing scripts) and "sources" (places accepting payloads). Common sinks include `eval()`, `<script>`, and `document.write()`, while sources involve `document.url`, `window.location`, and `localStorage`. Despite being less common now, XSS vulnerabilities persist due to increased user interaction and data persistence in web applications. XSS can be stored, reflected, or DOM-based, each with unique detection challenges.

CSRF attacks exploit the trust between a browser and a website, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of users without their knowledge. These attacks often target API endpoints requiring privileged access. By manipulating query parameters within HTTP GET requests, attackers can craft links that trick users into executing state-changing requests. For example, a malicious link can be disguised as a legitimate one, causing unintended actions when clicked.

GET requests are particularly vulnerable to CSRF due to their simplicity and widespread use in hyperlinks and images. Attackers can leverage HTML tags like `<img>` or `<video>` to initiate GET requests automatically when loaded into the DOM, requiring no user interaction. This makes GET requests an easy target for CSRF.

While GET requests are commonly exploited, CSRF can also target POST endpoints. This requires more effort, often involving HTML forms to submit POST requests. Hidden form fields can be used to seed data, and legitimate-looking forms can trick users into unknowingly submitting requests to targeted servers. This technique can exploit a user's session or network access to perform unauthorized actions.

Bypassing CSRF defenses involves exploiting weaknesses in validation mechanisms. Some defenses rely on validating headers like `referrer` or `origin`, which can be bypassed by omitting these headers using attributes like `rel=noreferrer` in links or forms. Additionally, some systems use token pools for CSRF defense, where generating a legitimate token within a user's account can bypass checks.

Overall, understanding the mechanics of XSS and CSRF, including their execution contexts, sinks, sources, and potential bypass techniques, is crucial for security testing and mitigation. These vulnerabilities, due to their stealth and potential impact, remain significant threats in web security.



**CSRF Attacks**

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks exploit the trust relationship between a web browser, a user, and a web server. They occur when a malicious website causes a user’s browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site where the user is authenticated. CSRF tokens are used to prevent these attacks, but weaknesses in their implementation can be exploited. Predictable tokens, such as those based on timestamps or usernames, can be forged. Manipulating content types or bypassing regex filters can also enable CSRF attacks. Techniques like using iframes or AJAX requests can facilitate these attacks without user interaction.

**XXE Attacks**

XML External Entity (XXE) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers by using external entities to access or manipulate server files. These attacks occur when an application processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity. XXE can lead to data leaks, denial of service, or remote code execution. Direct XXE involves sending malicious XML directly to the server, while indirect XXE occurs when a server converts user input to XML before processing. Out-of-band data exfiltration can be used if the application does not return data directly. This involves accessing external DTD files to exfiltrate data over protocols like FTP.

**Vulnerabilities and Exploits**

Both CSRF and XXE attacks exploit the inherent trust and parsing mechanisms of web technologies. CSRF attacks leverage the trust model of web browsers, while XXE attacks exploit the flexibility of XML parsers. Understanding these vulnerabilities requires analyzing token generation, request structures, content types, and XML parser configurations. Developers must ensure strong token generation, validate request structures, and properly configure XML parsers to mitigate these risks. Additionally, staying informed about common bypass techniques and regularly updating security practices can help protect against these attacks.



The text outlines a comprehensive overview of account takeover (ATO) and injection attacks, focusing on Linux systems and web applications. Here's a concise summary:

### Account Takeover on Linux Systems

1. **User Data Acquisition**: Attackers target the `/etc/passwd` file to obtain system user data. This file contains information about user accounts, including usernames and password storage locations. The presence of an `x` in the password field indicates that the actual password hash is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file.

2. **Password Hash Extraction**: Attackers use vulnerabilities, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, to access `/etc/shadow`, which contains hashed passwords. Each entry includes a username, hashed password, and other password-related metadata. The hash format indicates the hashing algorithm used, such as MD5, SHA-256, or SHA-512.

3. **Cracking Password Hashes**: Tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat are used to crack these hashes. The process involves formatting the data from `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` using utilities like `unshadow` to make it compatible with these tools. Cracking is resource-intensive and benefits from powerful hardware.

4. **SSH Remote Login**: With cracked credentials, attackers can log into the server via SSH, gaining control over the compromised account. Tools like PuTTY can be used for SSH access on Windows systems.

### XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks

XXE attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers to read sensitive files, potentially leading to severe consequences like remote code execution. These attacks are often simple to initiate and can be mitigated by securing XML parser configurations.

### Injection Attacks

1. **SQL Injection**: This classic attack allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious inputs. It often results from poor coding practices, such as unsanitized input concatenation in SQL queries. PHP applications historically suffered from this due to interwoven PHP, SQL, and HTML code, but modern standards have reduced its prevalence.

2. **Code Injection**: Beyond SQL, code injection targets other interpreters or command-line interfaces (CLIs) used by web applications. For example, a Node.js server using a CLI for image compression could be vulnerable if filenames are not properly sanitized, allowing overwriting or executing unintended commands.

3. **Prevention**: Secure coding practices, such as input validation and parameterized queries, are essential to defend against injection attacks. Awareness and adherence to best practices significantly reduce vulnerabilities.

This summary captures the essence of the discussed attack vectors, emphasizing the importance of understanding system vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.



The text focuses on injection attacks, particularly code and command injection, and their implications. Code injection involves exploiting improperly written APIs to make interpreters or CLIs perform unintended actions. Command injection is a more severe form, where unintended actions are executed against an OS, potentially compromising the entire system.

An example is provided using a video converter library where user inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing additional commands to be injected. This could lead to unauthorized modifications or deletions of files. The text emphasizes the importance of sanitizing strings to prevent such vulnerabilities.

Command injection poses significant risks, especially when executed against Unix-based systems, which host over 95% of servers. If commands are interpreted as a superuser, attackers can access critical files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, and SSH keys. This access can lead to data theft, log manipulation, unauthorized user creation, or even server destruction.

Mitigations include robust permission systems on Unix-based OSs, which can reduce risks by forcing APIs to run as unprivileged users. However, many applications fail to implement these measures.

The text also discusses data exfiltration techniques in the context of SQL injection. In-band exfiltration allows attackers to see results directly, while out-of-band techniques involve sending data to an attacker-controlled server. Inferential or blind exfiltration uses server behavior (e.g., delays) to infer data.

Bypassing defenses like blocklists is possible by encoding payloads (e.g., using base64) to evade detection. Blocklists are less effective than allowlists because they can be circumvented by altering the payload's representation.

Injection attacks are not limited to SQL but extend to various technologies. They arise from over-trusting user input and can achieve data theft, account takeover, and more. Understanding an application's function is crucial for exploiting these vulnerabilities effectively.

Overall, the text highlights the critical nature of injection attacks, their potential impact, and the importance of implementing strong security measures to mitigate these risks.



The text discusses various types of denial of service (DoS) attacks, focusing on distributed denial of service (DDoS) and regular expression (regex) DoS vulnerabilities. DoS attacks involve overwhelming a server with requests, impairing its functionality for legitimate users. DDoS attacks are a more severe form, utilizing a network of devices to flood a server, often causing significant disruptions.

Regex DoS vulnerabilities are common in web applications, arising from inefficient regex patterns that cause excessive backtracking, slowing down the application. Malicious regex, often formed using greedy operators like "+", can be crafted to exploit these vulnerabilities. For example, the regex `^((ab)*)+$` can cause significant performance issues when matched against specific inputs, leading to server slowdowns or crashes.

Logical DoS vulnerabilities occur when server resources are drained by illegitimate users, affecting legitimate users' access. These often involve resource-intensive operations like database writes, file backups, or complex API calls. For instance, a photo-sharing application might be vulnerable if it performs multiple intensive operations during a photo upload. By understanding the application's backend structure, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to degrade server performance.

DDoS attacks involve multiple attackers or bots (botnets) overwhelming a server, often at the network level. These attacks typically use UDP traffic to consume bandwidth, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate requests. Botnets are often composed of compromised devices controlled remotely, complicating detection.

Advanced DoS techniques include YoYo attacks and compression attacks. YoYo attacks exploit autoscaling features in cloud services, repeatedly increasing and then decreasing resource demands, causing performance degradation and increased costs. Compression attacks target applications that process user-uploaded files, like video hosting sites. Malformed files can exploit vulnerabilities in compression libraries, consuming excessive resources and impacting user experience.

Overall, DoS attacks, whether through regex, logical, or distributed means, exploit application or network vulnerabilities to disrupt services. Understanding these attack vectors is crucial for developing effective defenses and ensuring application robustness.



In the context of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, tools like FFMPEG and ImageMagick, used for handling complex file uploads, can be exploited by attackers using malformed payloads. Proxy-based DoS attacks leverage intermediary services, such as search engine crawlers, to direct excessive requests to a target, reducing the attacker's resource costs and complicating detection. Classic DDoS attacks consume server resources, impacting user performance and potentially leading to application lockout. Investigating server resources and APIs is crucial for identifying DoS vulnerabilities.

Modern programming languages often treat data as objects and actions as functions. Mass assignment attacks exploit this by altering unintended fields via unvalidated objects passed to functions. For example, a video game API endpoint might inadvertently allow a user to gain admin privileges by modifying a payload due to lack of validation. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when objects are directly accessible via user-supplied parameters, leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

Serialization attacks exploit the conversion of data for network transmission. Vulnerabilities arise when serialization fails to properly escape data, potentially leading to code execution. For instance, the npm library `serialize-javascript` had vulnerabilities allowing code injection through improperly serialized JSON objects. Identifying vulnerable functions and crafting payloads are key steps in executing serialization attacks.

Client-side attacks have become more prevalent with the shift to Web 2.0, where complex operations are handled by both server and client. Client-targeted attacks, like regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), can affect both server and client environments. Client-specific attacks exploit vulnerabilities unique to the client, such as JavaScript in browsers, without requiring server interaction. Understanding these attack vectors is essential for securing both client and server components of modern web applications.



Client-side attacks, such as DOM-based cross-site scripting (DOM XSS), occur entirely within the browser, making them difficult to detect and trace. Unlike stored or reflected XSS, both the source and sink in DOM XSS are in the browser, allowing payloads to bypass server monitoring. This makes client-side attacks attractive for hackers and bug bounty hunters, as they often remain undetected.

Prototype pollution attacks exploit JavaScript's prototypal inheritance, allowing attackers to compromise objects indirectly. By altering the prototype of an accessible object, attackers can affect related objects, even without direct access. For instance, modifying the `toString()` function on a prototype can impact all instances derived from it. This attack can lead to denial of service, property injection, or remote code execution, especially if a vulnerable script execution sink is present.

Clickjacking involves tricking users into interacting with transparent or disguised UI elements, redirecting their input to malicious targets. A notorious example is the Adobe Flash exploit, where users unknowingly granted camera and microphone access. Modern clickjacking often uses invisible iframes to capture user actions on legitimate-looking sites, potentially accessing session cookies and executing privileged requests.

Tabnabbing and reverse tabnabbing manipulate browser tabs to redirect users to phishing sites. By abusing the `window.open()` function, attackers can change the destination of an opened tab after a delay, leading users to malicious sites that mimic legitimate ones. This attack relies on users verifying the legitimacy of a site before the redirection occurs.

Overall, these client-side attacks exploit browser vulnerabilities and user trust, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and user awareness.



Tabnabbing and reverse tabnabbing are client-side attacks exploiting browser DOM API vulnerabilities. In a tabnabbing attack, a user is tricked into opening a new tab with a legitimate-looking site, which is then replaced by a malicious one to steal credentials. This is facilitated by the `window.open` function, which allows the original tab to control the new tab.

Reverse tabnabbing works oppositely: the malicious site is opened in a new tab and targets the original tab. This can be achieved using the `window.opener` property, allowing the new tab to redirect the original tab to a malicious site. If `window.opener` is unavailable, attackers can exploit HTML links with `target=_blank` or use iframes to perform similar attacks.

Client-side attacks like tabnabbing, clickjacking, and prototype pollution compromise user application states without server detection. Understanding these attacks is crucial for security specialists.

Exploiting third-party dependencies, especially open-source software (OSS), poses significant security risks. Many modern applications rely on OSS, which may not undergo rigorous security audits. Hackers exploit these vulnerabilities, as OSS codebases are frequently updated and challenging to audit thoroughly.

Integration methods with OSS include direct source code integration, package managers, and self-hosted applications. Direct integration involves copying code, which may complicate updates. Package managers like npm streamline dependency management but have security vulnerabilities, such as dependency hijacking and compromised maintainer credentials.

Notable npm incidents include the removal of `left-pad`, breaking numerous applications, and the `eslint-scope` and `event-stream` attacks, where compromised packages introduced malicious code. These incidents highlight the risks of using package managers, as evaluating each dependency can be impractical.

Overall, while OSS and package managers offer convenience, they require careful security considerations to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and attacks.



Package managers like npm (JavaScript) and Maven (Java) are integral in software development but pose security risks. They can be exploited through malicious packages or dependencies, often requiring social engineering and code obfuscation. These risks are not limited to a specific language; C#, C++, and others also face similar threats.

Exploiting third-party dependencies often involves leveraging known vulnerabilities, which are documented in databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). These databases are invaluable for identifying vulnerabilities in widely used libraries, such as jQuery, which is under constant scrutiny due to its extensive use. However, smaller packages may not be as thoroughly examined, making them less likely to appear in such databases.

The widespread use of third-party dependencies introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited more easily than first-party code, as they often lack rigorous review processes. This makes them a prime target for attackers, emphasizing the need for thorough reconnaissance to understand their role in complex applications.

Business logic vulnerabilities differ as they are unique to an application's specific rules rather than common application logic. These vulnerabilities require a deep understanding of the business rules and are often challenging to detect and exploit. They can have significant impacts if leveraged, as they may bypass intended functionality while adhering to programmed rules.

Examples include math-related vulnerabilities, where missing validations can lead to financial discrepancies, and programmed side effects, where unintended changes occur due to unforeseen use of functionality. A case study with MegaCrypto illustrates how these side effects can be exploited for financial gain by manipulating local market conditions.

Quasi-cash attacks highlight vulnerabilities in primary functionalities, especially when multiple systems interact. For instance, MegaBank's MegaCard offered a high cashback rate, which could be exploited if not properly monitored, resulting in financial losses.

Overall, understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities require a comprehensive approach, focusing on both technical and business logic aspects to ensure robust security in web applications.



Henry Hacker, formerly of EvilCorp, discovered a business logic vulnerability using the PayBuddy API and MegaCard rewards. By automating a sequence of transactions, Henry exploited a loophole to gain $40 per cycle, achieving $2,400 in rewards per hour. This exploit capitalized on a quasi-cash transaction vulnerability, where PayBuddy acted as a financial intermediary, allowing rapid, automated self-transactions. MegaBank's oversight in application logic enabled this, as they did not anticipate a customer acting as both vendor and purchaser.

Business logic vulnerabilities, like the one Henry exploited, are complex and often unique to specific applications. They require deep understanding of application logic and intended use cases. Identifying these vulnerabilities involves considering edge cases and unintended use scenarios, such as currency conversion inconsistencies or reward system loopholes.

A common source of such vulnerabilities is numeric precision loss, often due to the IEEE754 floating-point format used by many programming languages. This format, while memory efficient, can result in precision loss, leading to significant financial discrepancies in automated calculations.

To exploit business logic vulnerabilities, one must understand the application's business model and logic. This involves mapping intended functionalities and identifying edge cases that might not be properly addressed. Techniques include testing different transaction scenarios and leveraging reward systems in unintended ways.

The complexity of these vulnerabilities makes them difficult to detect automatically. They require creativity and a nuanced understanding of both the application and potential attack vectors. Mastery in uncovering these vulnerabilities is highly sought after in security testing.

In defending against such vulnerabilities, understanding the hacker's perspective is crucial. Prioritizing defenses, similar to fortifying a medieval castle, involves focusing on the most vulnerable points. Security engineers must balance recon, offensive, and defensive skills to effectively mitigate risks.

Overall, securing modern web applications demands a comprehensive approach, integrating secure-by-default architectures, avoiding insecure patterns, and employing robust security reviews. Continuous learning and adaptation are essential to stay ahead of potential threats and develop hacker-resistant applications.



In securing modern web applications, the process begins with a defensive software architecture, emphasizing the importance of analyzing data flow and threat modeling. Addressing security flaws during the architecture phase is crucial as it is more cost-effective compared to post-deployment fixes. Re-architecting after user adoption can be costly and disruptive, especially for applications that allow extensive user customization.

Comprehensive code reviews are essential in maintaining security standards. These reviews should be conducted by both the developer's team and an unrelated team to ensure objectivity. Key focus areas include data transmission, storage, client presentation, and server operations. This step aims to catch security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

Vulnerability discovery is the next step, involving proactive measures such as bug bounty programs, internal red/blue teams, third-party penetration testers, and corporate incentives. These methods help identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited publicly, preventing financial and reputational damage.

Once vulnerabilities are identified, vulnerability analysis and management involve assessing their risk level, prioritizing fixes, and ensuring timely resolution. Factors such as financial risk, exploitation difficulty, and data type are considered. Logging and tracking are crucial to prevent exploitation during the fix process.

Regression testing ensures that vulnerabilities do not reappear after fixes are deployed. Implementing a regression testing framework is cost-effective and prevents previously closed bugs from reopening, saving time and resources in the long run.

Mitigation strategies span from architecture to regression testing, incorporating secure coding practices, secure application architecture, and a secure-by-default mindset. These strategies aim to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the codebase.

Applied recon and offense techniques provide insights into building stronger defenses. Understanding common vulnerabilities and exploit categories helps prioritize fixes and enhance security measures.

Secure application architecture is fundamental. It involves designing modules, determining data storage methods, and evaluating third-party dependencies. The architecture phase is critical as vulnerabilities are cheaper to fix at this stage than later in production.

Analyzing feature requirements involves evaluating business needs for potential security risks. This includes assessing authentication, authorization, personal data handling, and search engine implementation. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are crucial for encrypting data in transit, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Overall, securing web applications requires a comprehensive approach encompassing architecture, code reviews, vulnerability management, regression testing, and mitigation strategies. Each step builds on the previous to enhance security, reduce risks, and protect against potential threats.



In cryptography, password entropy is crucial for security, emphasizing randomness and uniqueness. Common passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute force attacks. To improve security, passwords should avoid patterns, common words, and personal information. Rejecting passwords from common lists and prohibiting the use of personal data like names and birthdates can enhance security.

When storing passwords, hashing is essential. Hashing algorithms, unlike encryption, are irreversible, preventing unauthorized access even by staff. Modern algorithms like BCrypt and PBKDF2 are recommended due to their resistance to attacks and ability to slow down brute force attempts. BCrypt, derived from Blowfish and Crypt, becomes slower with faster hardware, enhancing security. PBKDF2 uses key stretching to increase computational expense for brute force attacks.

Multifactor authentication (MFA) provides an additional security layer. It typically involves a password and a code from a mobile app or SMS, though hardware tokens offer more security. MFA significantly reduces unauthorized access risks by requiring both the password and the physical device.

Handling personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data requires legal compliance and secure storage to prevent misuse in case of breaches. Outsourcing data storage to specialized services can be more effective for smaller companies.

Implementing search engines in web applications requires separate databases for efficiency, which introduces security challenges. Synchronization issues and potential data exposure need careful consideration. Elasticsearch is a popular open-source option for search functionality.

Zero Trust Architecture emphasizes explicit over implicit trust. It requires verification for every privileged action, reducing vulnerabilities. Inspired by a 1994 thesis and revitalized by a 2020 NIST whitepaper, Zero Trust focuses on continuous verification and minimal trust zones, aligning with the principle of least privilege.

Applications should be designed with security in mind from the start. Addressing security flaws during the architecture phase is significantly less costly than fixing them in production. Early detection prevents reliance on insecure functionality, extensive rewrites, and potential exploitation, which can lead to financial and reputational damage.

Overall, secure application development involves robust password protocols, MFA, careful handling of sensitive data, and adherence to modern security architectures like Zero Trust to mitigate risks and protect user information.



The architecture phase is critical for addressing security concerns, as resolving issues early can save costs and prevent future complications. Secure web applications rely on proper configuration of browser security mechanisms. Content Security Policy (CSP) is a key tool to prevent attacks like XSS and phishing. CSP can be implemented via a server header or a meta tag in HTML, with directives specifying security rules. Important directives include `default-src` for source whitelisting, `sandbox` for resource isolation, and `frame-ancestors` to prevent clickjacking. CSP policies can be strict, using nonce or hash-based methods to secure inline scripts.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) complements CSP by managing cross-origin requests. It enforces the Same Origin Policy (SOP) to prevent unauthorized network requests, which could lead to CSRF attacks. CORS requests can be simple or preflighted, with the latter providing more security checks. Implementing CORS requires server-side configuration to match allowed origins and methods.

Security headers play a vital role in enhancing web application security. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) ensures HTTPS usage, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. Cross-Origin-Opener Policy (COOP) and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) manage browsing context sharing and resource access, mitigating risks like Spectre attacks. Additional headers like `X-Content-Type-Options` and `Content-Type` prevent MIME type sniffing, adding further protection.

Overall, a comprehensive approach utilizing CSP, CORS, and security headers is essential for robust web application security, reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing user protection.



### Legacy Security Headers

Legacy security headers have been largely replaced by Content Security Policy (CSP) and default browser features. Key headers and their modern equivalents include:

- **X-Frame-Options**: Replaced by CSP `frame-ancestors`.
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Removed; CSP now blocks common XSS vectors.
- **Expect-CT**: Removed; certificate transparency is default for TLS certificates post-May 2018.
- **Referrer-Policy**: Modern browsers limit referrer information; legacy browsers can be configured with `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- **X-Powered-By**: Often disabled to prevent server fingerprinting.
- **X-Download-Options**: Deprecated with Internet Explorer.

### Cookies

Cookies remain the primary method for user authentication in web applications. Secure cookies using attributes:

- **Path**: Limits the scope of cookies to specific paths.
- **Secure**: Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
- **Expires**: Sets cookie expiration dates.
- **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript access to cookies, mitigating XSS attacks.
- **SameSite**: Prevents CSRF by controlling cross-site cookie sending.

Avoid using the `domain` attribute unless necessary, as it expands cookie access to subdomains.

### Testing Cookies

Cookies can be tested using interception tools like Burp Suite and ZAP, or browser developer tools available in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Edge. These tools allow developers to simulate attacks and inspect cookies.

### Framing and Sandboxing

Running third-party code poses risks, mitigated by sandboxing methods:

- **Iframes**: Create isolated contexts but have UI and performance limitations. Use the `sandbox` attribute for additional security.
- **Web Workers**: Offer isolation by running code in separate threads without DOM access.
- **Subresource Integrity**: Verifies third-party code integrity using hashes.
- **Shadow Realms**: An upcoming feature for isolated JavaScript execution, promising better performance and synchronous execution.

### Secure User Experience

Designing secure UIs involves balancing information disclosure with user experience. Avoid excessive error message details that could aid attackers. Implement error handling that provides user-friendly messages without exposing sensitive server information.

### Information Disclosures and Enumeration

Carefully manage the amount of information exposed to users. Over-disclosure can lead to security vulnerabilities. Aim for minimal and necessary information in error messages and UI elements to maintain security without compromising user experience.



Developers should avoid disclosing application source code information to prevent fingerprinting, but sharing server state information can be useful if filtered properly. Error messages should be generic and use an allowlist of common failure cases to minimize risk. For example, replace specific error details with general messages to avoid information leakage. HTTP error codes should also be generic, like "400 - bad request," to prevent server reconnaissance. However, using more specific codes may be necessary if APIs require detailed status information, but these should be evaluated for potential state exposure.

Enumeration vulnerabilities occur when similar queries disclose unintended information. For example, if an API allows user ID lookups sequentially, an attacker can deduce the total number of users. Enumeration can also help attackers identify valid accounts by analyzing authentication error messages. To prevent this, errors should be generic, avoid predictable patterns, and enforce rate limits to reduce the risk of information exposure.

Secure user experience involves guiding users to make better security choices. Light patterns, unlike dark patterns that trick users, gently steer users towards secure actions. For instance, a cryptocurrency wallet could use light patterns to encourage users to set daily transaction limits, reducing risk if compromised. These patterns should be integrated across all relevant functionalities rather than just settings pages.

Threat modeling improves application security by identifying threats, actors, risks, mitigations, and the gap between them. It serves as a living document that helps transfer security knowledge within an organization. A comprehensive threat model documents application logic to identify logic vulnerabilities, which are unique to each application's business requirements. For example, allowing a user to submit a score beyond the intended range due to bypassing the web form could be a logic vulnerability.

When implementing threat models, it's crucial to document knowledge, identify risks and mitigations, and ensure that risks are actionable. This prevents unnecessary mitigations that could introduce bugs or vulnerabilities. A well-designed threat model enhances security posture and facilitates effective knowledge transfer among engineers.

In conclusion, the design of user experiences and threat models should prioritize security by providing generic error messages, preventing enumeration, using light patterns, and documenting application logic. This approach helps guide users towards secure practices and mitigates vulnerabilities, enhancing overall application security.



Threat modeling is a critical process in identifying and mitigating potential security risks in applications. It involves several key steps, including technical design documentation, identifying threat actors, and assessing attack vectors.

**Technical Design Documentation**: This step involves collecting comprehensive technical details to identify potential threats within an application's architecture. Key variables include the tools and technologies used, third-party services, data flow mechanisms, network configurations, and authentication controls. For example, in MegaBank’s user review feature, technical design includes components such as `getReviews` and `createReview`, which interact with AWS EC2 and PostgreSQL databases. Data is encrypted via TLS 1.3, and APIs are queryable via GraphQL.

**Threat Identification (Threat Actors)**: This involves identifying potential attackers, both human and machine, and understanding their permissions. Threat actors can include admin users, customer support, scripts, authenticated users, and unauthenticated users. Each actor has different levels of access and potential to exploit vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or unauthorized data access.

**Threat Identification (Attack Vectors)**: Attack vectors are potential pathways for threats. They are identified by analyzing logic design, technical design, and threat actors. Examples include improper validation, information disclosure, SQL injection, and GraphQL vulnerabilities. Each vector is ranked by severity to prioritize mitigation efforts.

**Mitigations**: For each identified attack vector, appropriate mitigations are proposed. For instance, validation logic can prevent improper data entries, and SQL injection mitigations involve using prepared statements. Unmitigated vectors are addressed by developing new strategies, such as implementing generic error messages, setting GraphQL compute limits, and reworking privileged permissions.

**Delta Identification**: This phase involves cross-referencing attack vectors with existing mitigations to identify gaps. Unmitigated vectors require brainstorming for new solutions to ensure comprehensive security before feature deployment.

Threat modeling not only helps in documenting technical and security knowledge but also in identifying potential vulnerabilities and attackers before development. It ensures that resources are effectively allocated to mitigate significant risks, ultimately safeguarding the application from both internal and external threats.



Security should be integrated early in the development phase to minimize costs. A robust threat model is essential, as fixing issues during architecture can save significant time post-launch. Code reviews must follow architecture reviews to ensure security. While rapid development is common, it shouldn't bypass proper security processes. Major features should be reviewed architecturally before code is developed. Code security reviews, ideally conducted during merge requests, provide an unbiased perspective, potentially catching unknown bugs and architecture flaws. This step is crucial for both security and functionality, significantly reducing high-impact security bugs in production.

Security reviews can be integrated into the development process at various stages, such as per commit or through pair programming, especially for mission-critical features. The timing of security reviews should align with the organization's processes. A security review should start by pulling the relevant branch to a local environment, as this offers more comprehensive tools than web-based editors. The review process begins with checking differences between the main and feature branches using tools like `git diff`.

Code security reviews focus on common vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF, but also on business logic vulnerabilities, which require understanding the feature's context, users, functionality, and business impact. For instance, a feature allowing different user roles must be scrutinized for vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

When starting a security review, prioritize high-risk components, especially if new to the application. Begin with client-side code to understand business logic, then evaluate the API layer and its dependencies, including databases and helper libraries. Review public-facing APIs that might be unintentionally exposed. This method helps prioritize user-facing functionality while leaving low-risk areas for later.

Secure coding requires awareness of anti-patterns such as blocklists, which are temporary solutions that can be bypassed. Instead, allowlists are preferred, ensuring only verified entities are permitted. Boilerplate code, often insecure by default, should be thoroughly evaluated before production use. Trust-by-default models should be avoided by implementing proper permissions for different functionalities.

In summary, integrating security throughout the development lifecycle, from architecture to code reviews, and being vigilant about common anti-patterns, significantly enhances an application's security posture.



In secure application design, permissions should be modularized, with each function operating under its own user account and permissions, preventing vulnerabilities in one module from affecting others. Client/server separation is crucial; tightly coupled systems are easier to exploit. A secure application should have independently developed client and server components that communicate over a network using a predefined format. Proper separation simplifies security mechanisms and reduces complex interactions.

Security reviews should go beyond common vulnerabilities, identifying anti-patterns that could become problematic. Reviews must be comprehensive, focusing on high-risk areas, and integrated into the development pipeline. Security-knowledgeable engineers should perform these reviews alongside developers.

Even with secure architecture and reviews, vulnerabilities can emerge, necessitating vulnerability discovery processes targeting production code. Security automation is key, employing static analysis, dynamic analysis, and vulnerability regression testing. Static analysis tools like Checkmarx and PMD evaluate code for syntax errors and common vulnerabilities but may produce false positives, especially with dynamic languages like JavaScript. Dynamic analysis, requiring code execution, is slower and costlier but effective in identifying actual vulnerabilities. Tools like IBM AppScan and Veracode are examples.

Vulnerability regression testing ensures previously fixed vulnerabilities do not reappear. These tests should be integrated into commit or push hooks. Responsible disclosure programs encourage users to report vulnerabilities without legal risk, improving security and public perception. Bug bounty programs incentivize vulnerability reporting, with platforms like HackerOne facilitating these processes.

Third-party penetration testing provides additional security insights, identifying vulnerabilities not found by internal teams. These testers, unlike bug bounty hunters, are contracted to assess security systematically.

Overall, secure application development involves modular permissions, separation of concerns, comprehensive security reviews, and robust vulnerability discovery and disclosure processes. Automation and external testing enhance security posture, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.



In vulnerability management, penetration testing is crucial for identifying security weaknesses in web applications. Freelance testers work independently, while firms can access source code for thorough testing. Testing should target high-risk areas before and after release to ensure security across platforms.

A structured Security Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) is vital for managing vulnerabilities from architecture to production. Vulnerability management involves reproducing vulnerabilities in a staging environment to verify their existence and avoid false positives. Automation is key for efficiency.

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, it must be ranked by severity using a scoring system like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). CVSS evaluates vulnerabilities based on factors such as attack vector, complexity, required privileges, and potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Scores range from 0 to 10, guiding prioritization for fixes.

CVSS also includes temporal and environmental scoring. Temporal scoring assesses the maturity of security measures at the time of reporting, while environmental scoring considers the specific context and requirements of the application.

After triaging, vulnerabilities should be addressed with permanent solutions. If a complete fix isn't feasible, temporary measures should be implemented, and additional bugs logged for unresolved issues. Regression tests are essential to prevent reoccurrence.

Defending against XSS attacks involves secure coding practices, like avoiding unsanitized user data in the DOM. Mitigation techniques should be applied to prevent script execution vulnerabilities.

Effective vulnerability management reduces organizational risk by ensuring vulnerabilities are efficiently identified, scored, and resolved. Following these steps helps maintain application security and integrity.



In web development, preventing XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks is crucial when handling user-supplied data in the DOM. It's essential to ensure that data is interpreted as text rather than DOM elements. JavaScript provides methods to check if data is string-like, using `typeof` checks or `JSON.parse()`. For safer DOM manipulation, use `innerText` instead of `innerHTML` to prevent HTML tags from being interpreted as code.

Sanitization is vital when allowing specific HTML tags, such as `<strong>` or `<i>`, while blocking others like `<script>`. Malicious scripts can still execute through various techniques, such as using JavaScript pseudoschemes or `String.fromCharCode()`. It's challenging to achieve complete sanitization, especially with APIs like `element.innerHTML`, `Blob`, `SVG`, `document.write`, `DOMParser.parseFromString`, and others, which can easily become XSS sinks.

For instance, `DOMParser` can convert strings into DOM nodes, potentially executing scripts. Using `document.createElement()` and `document.appendChild()` provides more control over DOM structure, reducing risk. SVGs and Blobs pose significant risks due to their ability to execute scripts, making them dangerous when handling user data.

When creating links from user input, sanitization is necessary to prevent script execution. Modern browsers offer robust filtering for `<a>` tags, which can be leveraged by creating dummy elements to sanitize URLs. Encoding functions like `encodeURIComponent()` are safer than custom solutions but should not be used for entire URLs due to HTTP spec compliance issues.

HTML entity encoding is another preventive measure, converting characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` into their entity forms to prevent script execution. However, this method is ineffective for content within `<script>` tags, CSS, or URLs.

CSS can also be an attack vector, capable of initiating HTTP requests via `background:url` attributes. To prevent CSS-based attacks, disallow user-uploaded stylesheets, or restrict user modifications to non-HTTP initiating fields.

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a powerful tool for XSS prevention, allowing developers to specify which scripts can execute in their application. By setting `script-src` directives, developers can restrict script sources and disable risky practices like `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`. Implementing CSP can be done via HTTP headers or `<meta>` tags, providing a first line of defense against XSS by controlling code execution environments.

Overall, defending against XSS requires a combination of safe DOM manipulation practices, thorough sanitization, encoding strategies, and robust security policies like CSP to mitigate risks effectively.



### Defending Against XSS Attacks

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common threat that can be mitigated at various levels, but the client-side is often the most effective. Implementing anti-XSS coding practices, such as using centralized DOM manipulation functions and sanitization, is crucial. Content Security Policy (CSP) can help protect against common XSS but not DOM-based XSS. Comprehensive security requires multiple layers of defense.

### Defending Against CSRF Attacks

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks exploit authenticated sessions to perform unauthorized actions. Mitigation strategies include header verification, where the `origin` and `referer` headers are checked to ensure requests come from trusted sources. However, these headers can be bypassed if an attacker gains XSS on an allowlisted origin. Therefore, CSRF tokens are a more robust defense, as they are unique per session and difficult for attackers to replicate. Stateless designs can incorporate CSRF tokens with encryption, using a unique user identifier, a timestamp, and a cryptographic nonce.

Best practices include avoiding state changes via HTTP GET requests and implementing application-wide CSRF defenses and middleware to validate headers and tokens. These strategies reduce the risk of CSRF attacks, allowing users to safely interact with your application.

### Defending Against XXE Attacks

XML External Entity (XXE) attacks can be prevented by disabling external entities in XML parsers. This is typically a simple configuration change but is crucial, especially in Java-based parsers where XXE might be enabled by default. Re-evaluating the use of XML in favor of alternatives like JSON can also reduce risks, as JSON is more lightweight and secure. However, if XML is necessary, ensure strict parser configuration to prevent potential data breaches or server compromises.

### Advanced XXE Risks

XXE attacks may start as read-only but can escalate to more severe threats like remote code execution. This makes them particularly dangerous, necessitating thorough checks of XML parser configurations to prevent vulnerabilities.

### Summary

XSS, CSRF, and XXE attacks pose significant threats to web applications. Effective defense involves a combination of best practices, such as proper header verification, token implementation, and parser configuration. By employing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks and protect your application and users.



Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software that improperly handle user input, particularly in command-line interfaces (CLIs) and databases. SQL injection is the most prevalent form and can be mitigated using prepared statements, which separate SQL code from data inputs, preventing unintended query modifications. Prepared statements are supported by major databases like MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, and are essential for reducing SQL injection risks. 

Database-specific defenses include functions for escaping risky characters, such as MySQL's `QUOTE` and `mysql_real_escape_string()`, which help prevent SQL literal injection. However, these should not replace parameterization but serve as additional safeguards.

Beyond SQL, injection vulnerabilities can occur in any system that interprets user input, such as task schedulers, compression libraries, and remote scripts. To mitigate these, apply secure coding practices and the principle of least authority, which restricts system components to only necessary data and functions, reducing the impact of potential breaches.

When user commands must be executed on a server, use an allowlist approach to specify permissible commands, avoiding blocklists which can miss new or unintended functionalities. This prevents unauthorized command execution and reduces injection risks.

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to exhaust resources or deny access to services. Effective logging of server requests and asynchronous operations can help detect and mitigate DoS attempts by identifying unusual patterns or resource usage. Regex DoS, a specific form, can be prevented through careful code review to avoid complex regular expressions that cause excessive backtracking.

Overall, defending against these threats requires a combination of secure coding practices, proper configuration, and vigilant monitoring to minimize vulnerabilities and their potential exploitation.



Regular expressions (regex) can be vulnerable to DoS attacks if poorly constructed. Greedy matches (e.g., `(a[ab]*)+`) can lead to performance issues. To mitigate regex DoS, use OSS tools to scan for malicious patterns and avoid user-supplied regex. Logical DoS is harder to detect and can occur if logic is abused to consume resources. Evaluate code for DoS risks and consider resource usage.

DDoS attacks, unlike single-source DoS, involve multiple sources overwhelming a target with traffic. These attacks are hard to prevent but can be mitigated using bandwidth management services that analyze traffic patterns. Blackholing can redirect suspicious traffic but may affect legitimate users. Understanding user patterns is crucial to avoid blocking real traffic.

Mass assignment attacks occur when client data is trusted without validation. Use allowlists to restrict fields or Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to filter inputs. For IDOR protection, avoid direct object references and use complex filenames with authorization checks.

Serialization attacks exploit weak serialization. Use strong, well-tested libraries and sanitize data to prevent script interpretation. Allowlisting input can further reduce risks.

Prototype pollution in JavaScript exploits prototypal inheritance. Mitigations include key sanitization, using `Object.freeze()` to make objects immutable, and creating objects with null prototypes to prevent pollution.

Clickjacking defenses include using Content Security Policy (CSP) settings like `frame-ancestors` to control which sites can embed your content, replacing outdated methods like `X-Frame-Options`.

In summary, defending against DoS, DDoS, and various data attacks involves using appropriate tools, validating inputs, and understanding the architecture to prevent vulnerabilities. Regular updates and security audits are essential to maintain robust defenses.



In web security, Content Security Policy (CSP) and frame-ancestors directives are critical for preventing clickjacking by blocking unauthorized framing of web pages. Setting `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';` prevents pages from loading in iframes, thwarting most clickjacking attempts. If framing is necessary, specific domains can be allowlisted using `frame-ancestors subdomain.my-website.com`. Framebuster scripts, an alternative for browsers not supporting CSP, use JavaScript to hide content if framed, thus preventing interaction.

For tabnabbing prevention, the Cross-Origin-Opener Policy (COOP) should be set to `same-origin`, restricting window object access from links. The `noopener` and `noreferrer` attributes in links further enhance security by nullifying window references and hiding referrer data.

Isolation policies, part of the fetch metadata feature in modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox, provide additional security by sending headers (e.g., Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-Mode) that inform servers about request origins and modes. These headers can be used to prevent framing and mitigate client-side attacks.

Securing third-party dependencies is vital as they often have their own dependencies, creating complex trees. Tools like `npm ls` help visualize these trees. Automated tools can compare dependency trees against CVE databases to identify vulnerabilities. Secure integration involves separating concerns by running third-party code on isolated servers and using JSON for communication to minimize risks.

In package management, locking dependencies to specific versions using semantic versioning and `npm shrinkwrap` prevents unwanted updates. However, this doesn't protect against version number reuse by maintainers. To mitigate this, use Git SHAs or maintain a private package mirror.

Overall, understanding and implementing these security measures can significantly enhance the security posture of web applications, making them resilient against various client-side attacks and vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.



Third-party integrations in web applications reduce development time but introduce risks. To mitigate these, isolate dependencies on separate servers or environments, version-lock dependencies, and consider deploying your own package mirrors. Business logic vulnerabilities, difficult to detect and attack, require deep understanding of an application's logic. Mitigating these begins at the architecture phase with worst-case scenario design, accounting for unintended use cases. This approach helps identify vulnerabilities before code is written, saving time and resources.

Statistical modeling can aid in detecting business logic vulnerabilities by combining fuzzing with data science and browser automation. This involves modeling user inputs and actions, storing them in a format like JSON, and automating user flows using tools like headless browsers. Logging network requests during this process helps identify vulnerabilities.

Business logic vulnerabilities stem from overlooked edge cases or missing checks in application logic. They vary across applications, making them hard to detect and mitigate. Establishing a mindset of considering unintended use cases during development can improve security. These vulnerabilities, if neglected, become more dangerous as applications grow in complexity.

Modern web applications have increased attack surfaces due to complexities like third-party dependencies. Mitigations include Zero Trust Architecture, automated vulnerability discovery, and threat modeling. While specific tactics may evolve, the underlying design philosophies and analysis methods remain valuable.

Understanding historical hacking events, such as telephone phreaking and early computer viruses, provides insight into the evolution of security measures. The rise of Web 2.0 shifted hacker focus to logical vulnerabilities in application code. Today’s applications hold valuable data, increasing the stakes for security breaches. Implementing comprehensive, regularly updated security solutions is crucial in this landscape.



Modern web applications are increasingly complex, requiring collaboration between software developers and security experts to address logical vulnerabilities. Effective application reconnaissance is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities by thoroughly mapping the application and evaluating its components for risks. This process helps prioritize defenses and understand potential attack vectors.

Today's web applications are built on multiple technology layers, including server-to-user and user-to-user functionalities, broadening the potential surface area for attacks. They heavily rely on third-party dependencies, which may not be audited as rigorously as first-party code, making them attractive targets for hackers.

Reconnaissance involves mastering techniques to map a web application's surface area, including subdomains, APIs, and HTTP protocols. Understanding interactions between distributed web servers aids in prioritizing attacks. As web applications evolve, new protocols like sockets or RTC may become prevalent, necessitating adaptable recon techniques.

Several common attack types include:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exploits improper handling of user inputs to execute scripts.
