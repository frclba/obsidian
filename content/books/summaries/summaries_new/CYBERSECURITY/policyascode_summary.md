Jimmy Ray's book is a vital resource for DevOps, DevSecOps, and cloud engineers aiming to improve cloud-native security through Policy as Code. It bridges the gap between policy definition and enforcement, providing a structured approach to automated policy management in modern software development practices.



The text discusses the use of Policy as Code (PaC) in managing cloud environments, focusing on security, compliance, and governance. PaC allows for codifying policies to enforce behaviors, reducing nondeterministic actions in systems. The book targets DevOps practitioners, Kubernetes operators, and security engineers, aiming to provide insights into PaC concepts and solutions. It emphasizes vendor-neutral and cloud service provider (CSP) agnostic approaches, offering a reference for understanding PaC theory, use cases, and best practices.

PaC is described as using code artifacts to manage and apply rules and conditions, implemented through policy engines. These engines interpret policies to enforce organizational standards, preventing unwanted changes and ensuring best practices. Policies are modeled with components like name, purpose, situation, rules, and actions. The text highlights the importance of syntactical familiarity in policy languages, suggesting that familiar languages enhance adoption.

JSON and YAML are noted as popular formats in PaC due to their declarative nature, facilitating reliable evaluation by PaC solutions. The book provides a process for selecting appropriate PaC solutions, emphasizing the role of policies in achieving desired outcomes and preventing surprises.

The author acknowledges various contributors who provided technical reviews and expertise, particularly in Kubernetes, Open Policy Agent (OPA), and other related technologies. The text also highlights the support from O’Reilly Media in the writing process, with specific mentions of editors and colleagues who assisted in developing the content.

The book serves as a resource for learning about PaC, offering patterns and techniques applicable to security, compliance, and governance. It aims to guide readers in choosing the right PaC solutions for their needs, emphasizing the integration of PaC into IT systems to enhance security and operational efficiency.



Policy as Code (PaC) utilizes structured data formats like JSON and YAML for defining and enforcing policies in computing environments. These formats facilitate declarative, expressive, and self-documenting policies, which are easier to manage and convert between each other. PaC is instrumental in establishing guardrails to prevent unwanted actions in cloud computing, ensuring operations remain within defined boundaries. These guardrails act as controls that restrict actions violating set policies, such as preventing compute instances with public IPs.

PaC also supports a defense-in-depth (DiD) strategy, reacting to unplanned changes by enforcing policies that limit actions in environments like Kubernetes. Policies might include limiting container image sources to approved registries, enforcing security contexts, and managing network policies. These measures help mitigate risks from rogue code or unauthorized changes, aligning with a least privilege approach.

Open Source Software (OSS) plays a significant role in PaC solutions, offering cost savings and scalability through community contributions. However, OSS presents challenges like potential lack of support and control over project direction. Organizations should carefully consider OSS licensing, security, maturity, dependencies, and support activity. Engaging with OSS projects may involve contributing or maintaining projects to ensure alignment with organizational needs.

Standards and controls are crucial in linking PaC to organizational policies. Groups manage policies and standards, often adopting those from recognized bodies like NIST and CIS. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) teams work with subject matter experts to define controls that enforce standards. These controls, implemented via PaC, produce auditable artifacts to demonstrate compliance and satisfy auditors.

Overall, PaC enforces controls by preventing unwanted changes and promoting desired practices, providing traceability from broad organizational policies to specific implementations. This approach integrates with the broader trend of treating everything as code, enhancing flexibility and security in IT environments.



The text discusses the transition to "Everything as Code" (EaC), emphasizing the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Policy as Code (PaC) for IT resource management. IaC allows for provisioning and managing infrastructure with code, enhancing repeatability, scalability, and collaboration through automated processes. Tools like AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and Terraform's CDKTF blur lines between declarative and imperative approaches, offering flexibility and efficiency.

PaC introduces policies as executable, traceable, and auditable artifacts, integrating security and compliance into DevOps workflows. This codification allows for automated policy evaluations, reducing variability and increasing reliability in deployments. PaC is crucial for implementing Compliance as Code (CaC) and Security as Code (SaC), providing guardrails similar to test cases in Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Policy engines are central to PaC, interpreting policy languages and applying them to specific domains. They evaluate data against policies, supporting asynchronous data loading and external data lookups. Various policy engines, such as Cloud Custodian, Kyverno, and Open Policy Agent (OPA), offer different languages like YAML and Rego for policy writing.

Choosing the right PaC solution involves considering organizational alignment, use cases, community adoption, and user experience. A selection scorecard helps evaluate solutions based on weighted criteria like automation, complexity, and security. It's important to match solutions to organizational needs without overcomplicating with edge cases.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) supports open-source projects, promoting cloud-native technologies characterized by automation, scalability, and security. CNCF projects are categorized by maturity levels: sandbox, incubating, and graduated, indicating their readiness for use.

The text emphasizes vendor-neutral, cloud-agnostic PaC solutions, excluding CSP-specific tools like AWS Config and Azure Policy. It introduces a framework for selecting PaC solutions and highlights the importance of understanding project maturity and community support for effective implementation.



Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a mature, open-source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), known for its general-purpose and domain-agnostic capabilities. It allows for policy unification across various domains and stacks by evaluating data against provided policies and queries. OPA does not include built-in policies for specific technologies like Kubernetes or cloud platforms; instead, users input their own policies and data.

**Hello World Example:**
The Rego Playground, built by Styra, is a useful tool for understanding OPA's policy evaluation. A simple "Hello World" policy can be written in Rego, OPA's policy language, where JSON input is evaluated to produce an output. For example, a policy can match an input message and return a boolean result.

**Installation and Modes:**
OPA can be installed on macOS using Homebrew or via Docker for other platforms like Linux/AMD64. The OPA CLI provides various commands for managing policies and running different operational modes. The OPA CLI includes commands like `eval`, `build`, and `run`, which are essential for interacting with and managing OPA policies.

**OPA REPL:**
The read-eval-print loop (REPL) mode allows for interactive experimentation and policy development. Users can preload policies and input documents to evaluate them in real-time. The REPL environment supports immediate feedback, making it ideal for prototyping.

**OPA Server:**
OPA can run in server mode to act as a policy daemon across platforms. The server mode is commonly used in containerized environments like Docker or Kubernetes. It can be initialized with the `run -s` command, and policies can be loaded as bundles, which are collections of data and policies.

**Bundles:**
Bundles package policies and data for OPA, allowing for easier deployment. They can be created using the `opa build` command and inspected with `opa inspect`. Bundles can be signed for verification purposes, ensuring they originate from a trusted source. However, they are not typically used during local development.

**Querying the Server:**
Once the OPA server is running, it can be queried to evaluate policies against data inputs. This functionality is crucial for integrating OPA into larger systems where policy decisions need to be made dynamically.

Overall, OPA's flexibility and integration capabilities make it a powerful tool for implementing Policy as Code (PaC) solutions across diverse environments.



The text provides an overview of using Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its Rego policy language for managing and evaluating policies. It highlights the use of default values in policies to handle missing or incorrect input fields, ensuring consistent outputs. The example given demonstrates a simple "Hello World" policy where a default return value of `false` is used when inputs do not match specified criteria.

OPA's REST API is detailed, with emphasis on using HTTP POST requests to evaluate data against policies. The API's ability to handle JSON inputs and outputs makes it versatile across different domains. Performance metrics can be obtained using the `metrics` parameter, which provides insights into execution times for various operations, aiding in system design validation.

The document also explains OPA's CLI subcommands, `eval` and `exec`, used for evaluating policies. `Eval` is suitable for automation in CI/CD processes, while `exec` offers advanced features like using configuration files for remote bundles and decision logging. Both commands support machine-readable JSON outputs, enhancing their utility in automation.

Rego, the language used by OPA, is described as a declarative language designed for reasoning about structured data. It operates on a document model with base and virtual documents. Base documents are long-lived and stored in the `data` global variable, while virtual documents are created by OPA as policy decisions.

Rego's syntax includes rules that define virtual documents through evaluation. Rules consist of a head and a body, with logical expressions that must all be true for the rule to evaluate to true. The language supports logical AND and OR conditions, with multiple rules allowing for OR logic.

Functions in Rego help avoid code repetition and enhance modularity. They are similar to rules but take arguments. Built-in functions in Rego, such as `count`, `sum`, and `sprintf`, provide additional functionality and improve expressiveness.

The text also introduces Rego's support for compound data types like objects, arrays, and sets. Objects are unordered key-value pairs, arrays can hold multiple types, and sets contain unique values. Comprehensions, although not detailed, are mentioned as a feature.

Overall, the document serves as a guide to using OPA and Rego for policy management, emphasizing the flexibility and power of the Rego language in defining and evaluating policies across various domains.



The Rego policy language, used in Open Policy Agent (OPA), allows for creating compound values through set comprehensions, which convert arrays of duplicate values into unique sets. This feature is commonly used in Kubernetes policies for data aggregation and processing. Rego employs various operators for assignment and comparison, including the unique unification operator that combines both functions by assigning values to make expressions true. However, using explicit assignment and comparison operators is generally preferred to avoid ambiguity.

To write and test Rego policies, tools like the Rego Playground and VS Code integration are recommended. The Rego Playground offers features such as syntax highlighting, error checking, and testing capabilities. The OPA CLI provides commands for formatting and testing policies, with outputs available in JSON for automation purposes.

Advanced features of OPA include bundle signing, which ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of policy bundles. This process involves generating a private-public key pair using OpenSSL and signing bundles with the private key. Verification of these signatures is crucial to maintain security during updates.

OPA also supports WebAssembly (Wasm) for extending its functionality. Bundles can be built to include Wasm binaries, allowing integration with projects like the Open Policy Agent WebAssembly NPM Module. However, Wasm support is currently unavailable in OPA ARM64 binaries due to testing limitations.

OPA's extensibility is further enhanced through its APIs and SDKs, which facilitate integration with applications. These interfaces are categorized by evaluation and management purposes, including REST and Golang APIs, and various management APIs for deploying policies and collecting metrics.

OPA is a mature Policy as Code (PaC) solution, recognized by its CNCF graduated-project status. It offers a flexible policy language, Rego, which is powerful for evaluating structured data. Despite a learning curve, OPA supports various use cases and provides a robust user experience. It integrates well with systems through its APIs and SDKs, making it suitable for modern authorization challenges like role-based and attribute-based access control.

In summary, OPA's operational modes, Rego language capabilities, and integration options make it a comprehensive solution for policy enforcement and access control in diverse environments.



Privileged Access Management (PAM) is essential for controlling access in secured systems, focusing on who can access what, when, and for how long. The principle of least privilege (PoLP) ensures that users receive only the necessary permissions for a limited time. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a common model where permissions are tied to roles within an organization, simplifying management but requiring careful oversight and auditing.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) can implement RBAC by using policies that define permissions based on roles. OPA itself does not handle authentication; it relies on external identity providers to authenticate users, passing artifacts like JWTs to OPA for authorization decisions. In secure environments, OPA is deployed close to policy enforcement points, often avoiding complex AuthN/AuthZ configurations.

RBAC is exemplified in Kubernetes, where ClusterRoles and Roles define permissions across clusters and namespaces. These roles are bound to users or groups, providing a structured way to manage access. However, managing roles and permissions can become cumbersome in large organizations, necessitating automation and routine audits.

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) offers a more dynamic alternative by using attributes to determine access privileges. Unlike RBAC, ABAC does not rely on predefined roles but instead evaluates attributes of users and resources, allowing for more flexible and context-aware access decisions. This approach is particularly useful in environments where roles and permissions frequently change.

In summary, PAM involves technologies and strategies to manage privileged access, with RBAC and ABAC being two prevalent models. RBAC is straightforward but can become unwieldy at scale, while ABAC provides flexibility by leveraging attributes for access control. OPA supports these models by offering a platform for defining and enforcing access policies, though it requires integration with external systems for authentication.



Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) offers a flexible access management system by using actor and resource data independently, allowing for dynamic policy evaluations. ABAC decouples actor and resource metadata from policies, enabling changes in metadata without affecting the policy structure, unless data models change. This decoupling acts as a pace-layering mechanism, allowing independent changes at different cadences.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is used to handle ABAC policy evaluations. OPA functions as a policy enforcement, decision, administration, and information point. Policies and data are stored in OPA, which evaluates requests based on attributes from resource and user stores. An example policy allows operations based on attributes like user role, action type, and resource status. For instance, employees can read if on shift, and customers can read non-adopted pet data.

The data model is represented in JSON, storing user attributes, shift timings, and pet attributes. Time-handling logic ensures operations are performed only during valid shifts. OPA’s built-in time functions verify if operations occur within specified shifts on weekdays.

ABAC is more dynamic than Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), as modifying attributes can adapt access decisions without changing roles or grants. Policies drive decisions based on data from systems like HR or inventory. Tags and labels in a cloud environment are crucial for ABAC policies, necessitating controlled creation and modification.

Policy automation should provide context-rich authorization, decoupling policy decisions from application code. OPA policies and data can be bundled, signed, and distributed to OPA instances via a bundle server, which can be built using Golang. The server handles HTTPS requests and serves bundles, which can also be distributed via object storage like Amazon S3.

A bundle server example uses the gorilla/mux project for handling requests. OPA servers connect to bundle servers using configuration files, enabling automatic bundle download and activation. ETags are used to optimize server bandwidth by checking for changes before redownloading content.

To scale policy management, tools and services are needed to handle numerous authorization decisions and policy changes. Styra DAS, a SaaS product, offers centralized management and distribution for policies, allowing integration with OPA agents. DAS provides a unified platform to manage resources, systems, and policies, supporting multiple systems like Kubernetes and Istio.

Styra DAS Free allows users to start with no cost, providing an intuitive interface for managing systems and policies. DAS uses discovery to manage bundles instead of naming bundles directly. OPA servers connect to DAS using TLS and bearer tokens, facilitating secure communication and policy management.

Overall, ABAC and OPA provide a robust framework for dynamic access management, with tools like Styra DAS enhancing policy distribution and management capabilities across enterprise systems.



In the context of policy management and access control, the text discusses several tools and methodologies for managing policies as code (PaC), emphasizing the use of Open Policy Agent (OPA) and related technologies. Styra DAS is highlighted as a tool for centralizing policy management, providing near-real-time updates, and reducing the operational burden of OPA engines. It integrates with remote APIs for authorization (AuthZ) through Styra Run, which eliminates the need for local OPA instances by using SDKs to manage policies remotely.

Styra Run supports backend and frontend SDKs for languages like Golang, Java, Node.js, HTML/JavaScript, and React. It enables applications to directly instrument AuthZ and data filtering, positioning itself as a solution to offload local policy management.

Open Policy Administration Layer (OPAL) is introduced as an open-source project for managing authorization policies and data. It connects to policy and data stores, detects changes, and updates remote OPA agents. OPAL uses a Docker Compose setup to manage its components, utilizing a pub/sub model for efficient data propagation.

Additionally, Open Policy Containers (OPCR) is discussed as a tool for packaging and storing OPA policies and data as OCI images. This approach leverages containerization standards to manage policies, offering a promising vector for policy delivery.

The text emphasizes the differences between role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC), noting that RBAC is easier to audit but can become complex, while ABAC offers more dynamic control but is harder to audit due to its reliance on dispersed data.

Overall, the chapter underscores the utility of these tools in managing policies across enterprises, highlighting the importance of understanding different authorization models and the role of PaC in enhancing security and best practices, particularly in Kubernetes environments. The text sets the stage for deeper exploration of these solutions, focusing on their application in Kubernetes to prevent unwanted changes, guide best practices, and perform authorization.




The Kubernetes project is structured around Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and Working Groups (WGs), with sig-auth focusing on authentication, authorization, and security policy. The Policy WG, sponsored by sig-auth, works on policy management architecture. Kubernetes operations can be enhanced using Policy as Code (PaC), which addresses gaps in best practice adherence.

Kubernetes architecture is divided into control plane (CP) and data plane (DP) components, with the API server as the central hub for requests. Admission controllers, part of the API server, validate and mutate requests before changes are made to etcd, the key-value store for cluster configurations. These controllers can be static or dynamic, with the latter allowing custom policies through webhook integrations.

Dynamic admission controllers extend the API server's capabilities without modifying its core. They use mutating and validating webhooks to apply policies to requests, ensuring changes align with security and operational standards. Webhooks receive AdmissionReview API objects, which contain request details, allowing them to enforce policies based on the request content.

Webhook configurations define how these dynamic admission controllers interact with the API server. Mutating webhooks can alter requests before they proceed, while validating webhooks assess requests for compliance. Both types of webhooks are configured with rules specifying which requests they handle, and they must respond within a set timeout period.

AdmissionReview objects, sent to webhook services, contain the request payload and are crucial for policy matching and enforcement. These objects can be modeled using tools like kube-review for testing policies. Webhook responses must include elements like `allowed` and `uid`, indicating whether the request is permitted.

Webhook configurations include settings such as `failurePolicy`, which determines the API server's response to webhook call failures, either allowing or blocking requests. This setup provides flexibility but requires careful consideration of security and operational impacts.

External data can complement AdmissionReview objects for complex validations, such as verifying container image signatures or assessing existing cluster resources. This integration supports more nuanced policy enforcement beyond the immediate request context.

Overall, Kubernetes' use of PaC through dynamic admission controllers enhances security and operational control, allowing for customizable and scalable policy enforcement across clusters.



In Kubernetes, handling external data and managing API server requests are crucial for maintaining cluster integrity and security. External data can be integrated into the policy engine through various methods, such as pulling data at evaluation time or pushing data at startup. A key operation in the Kubernetes API server request flow is mutation, where mutating admission controllers modify incoming requests before validation. This process is similar to server-side actions in application development, where data is altered before being stored. Mutation use cases include injecting sidecar containers for service mesh proxies, adding labels or annotations, changing security settings, and more. Despite its benefits, mutation can be controversial, as it may introduce drift into requests.

Validation, on the other hand, prevents unwanted changes to clusters by enforcing security configurations, container resource settings, and multitenancy settings. Validating admission controllers ensure requests meet specific criteria before execution. An example policy might restrict operations in the default Namespace to prevent pollution and potential compromise.

API server request latency is affected by the number of admission controllers and webhooks. Mutating webhooks are executed serially, while validating webhooks run concurrently. Proper tuning of timeout settings is essential to prevent latency issues and ensure successful request processing.

Auditing and background scanning help identify missed violations when webhooks fail. Tools like Gatekeeper and Kyverno support these features, allowing for impact testing and analysis without disrupting existing resources. Additionally, PaC solutions can automate resource and policy generation, reducing management overhead. For example, Kyverno's Auto-Gen feature creates policies for Pods and their controllers, while its generate resources capability responds to cluster events by preparing Namespaces with necessary policies.

Native Kubernetes policy features include Pod Security Admission (PSA), which replaces the deprecated PodSecurityPolicy (PSP). PSA implements the Pod Security Standards (PSS) across three levels: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted. PSA modes—Enforce, Warn, and Audit—control Pod security by enforcing securityContext settings in Pods and containers. Namespaces can opt into specific security levels using labels, allowing for customizable security configurations.

Overall, Kubernetes offers a range of tools and practices for managing API server requests and maintaining cluster security, from external data integration to native policy features like PSA. Proper configuration and tuning of these tools are crucial for effective cluster management and security enforcement.



PSA Enforce is a Kubernetes mode that prevents Pod changes from occurring if they violate security policies, but it doesn't stop the creation of other resources like Deployments. When Pods are rejected due to policy violations, users must manually check Deployment statuses to identify issues. To improve user experience, PSA modes such as warn and audit provide feedback on possible security violations via logs, even if they don't prevent resource creation.

Policy as Code (PaC) solutions offer more granular control than PSA, allowing for enforcement of various Kubernetes resource behaviors. PaC can be used alongside PSA and PSS to enhance security and user experience, often employing Kubernetes dynamic admission controllers to enforce policies.

A new in-tree PaC feature, Validating Admission Policy (VAP), available from Kubernetes v1.28, allows for policy enforcement on both Pod and non-Pod resources without additional software. VAP uses Common Expression Language (CEL) for policy logic, enabling administrators to configure policies that enforce security best practices. VAP involves resources like ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding, and ParameterResource, which together define and apply policies.

AuthZ webhook mode in Kubernetes controls API server access, integrating with external and internal clients. While less common than RBAC, it provides granular security by allowing decisions to be made based on JSON payloads sent to webhook services. Multiple authorizers can be used, returning either allowed or denied decisions. The configuration uses kubeconfig format, enabling secure communication between the API server and webhook services.

PaC tools can facilitate AuthZ decisions by running within the cluster, enhancing response time and partition tolerance. For example, Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to restrict access to admin namespaces by defining policies that evaluate SubjectAccessReview objects.

Finally, PaC reporting is essential for verifying policy compliance and generating auditable artifacts. The Kubernetes Policy WG's PolicyReport CRD provides a standard format for reporting policy results, allowing for Namespaced and cluster-scoped reports. This integration helps satisfy regulatory requirements and improves transparency in policy enforcement.



The text discusses the implementation of Policy as Code (PaC) within Kubernetes, focusing on tools like Kyverno and Open Policy Agent (OPA). It highlights the use of PolicyReports to provide insights into policy validations, specifically using Kyverno to generate reports for ClusterPolicies, which are machine-readable and useful for human review.

The text explores the evolution of Kubernetes and PaC solutions, emphasizing the importance of admission controllers for mutating and validating API server requests. It covers new solutions like Pod Security Admission and Validating Admission Policy, and the use of webhooks for authorization (AuthZ) in Kubernetes clusters.

The text introduces Open Policy Agent (OPA) as a mature, domain-agnostic PaC solution used for evaluating Rego policies. It details the installation of OPA in Kubernetes, highlighting its integration as a validating webhook to handle API server requests. The installation process involves setting up TLS for secure communication and configuring webhook settings like timeout and failure policies.

The text provides a shell script example for automating the installation of OPA, which includes generating TLS certificates, creating Kubernetes resources, and configuring OPA server settings. It emphasizes the importance of using secure configurations, such as binding the OPA server to local addresses and using static images for compatibility.

Finally, the text mentions the availability of a Helm chart for OPA installation, offering flexibility in deploying OPA with or without its kube-mgmt sidecar. The overall focus is on ensuring that the PaC solutions are robust, secure, and tailored to specific Kubernetes use cases.



The text discusses the integration and management of Open Policy Agent (OPA) within Kubernetes, focusing on the use of kube-mgmt, a sidecar that manages OPA policies and data. Key processes involve checking the status of configmaps using JSONPath expressions and reviewing OPA server logs for health checks. Installation and uninstallation of OPA in Kubernetes are covered, including the use of shell scripts and make commands for automation. The importance of error handling in scripts is highlighted, with the use of utilities like ShellCheck for syntax verification.

Kube-mgmt operates within the same Kubernetes Pod as OPA, managing policies and data using the OPA REST API. It loads Rego-based policies from configmaps in the opa namespace, compiling them before loading into OPA. Successful operations are indicated by annotations, while errors may arise from connectivity issues or compilation failures. Kube-mgmt also replicates Kubernetes data into OPA, essential for policy decisions requiring more data than provided by API requests.

Data management involves loading Kubernetes resources and additional data from configmaps into OPA. This is verified through logs and API queries, using tools like cURL. Security is addressed through AuthZ policies, ensuring only authorized access to OPA. These policies allow minimal access for health checks and metrics, while kube-mgmt uses a token for privileged operations.

Kubernetes policies, particularly validation policies, use the AdmissionReview object to validate API server requests. Policies are stored in configmaps and matched to inbound requests for evaluation. A deny-all policy example illustrates resource validation, denying Pod operations and returning request objects for examination.

OPA's role as a Kubernetes dynamic webhook service is emphasized, requiring a policy entry point for operation. Missing entry points can lead to errors, disrupting cluster operations. The text underscores the necessity of correctly configuring OPA and kube-mgmt to ensure seamless integration and secure policy management within Kubernetes.



The Open Policy Agent (OPA) integrates with Kubernetes to handle admission control through validating and mutating webhooks. The main entry point for OPA is the system.main policy, which constructs the AdmissionReview.response. This response must match the request uid, include an allowed field (true/false), and provide a status object for validation failures. The system.main object is crucial for the webhook to function correctly, as missing it leads to validation errors.

OPA supports reusable code libraries, such as helper libraries, to streamline policy creation and reduce redundancy. These libraries help extract fields from the AdmissionReview object and define reusable functions, improving maintainability and reducing errors.

For mutating admission control, OPA uses JSON patch schemas defined in RFC 6902. Mutating webhooks modify inbound resources, like Pods, using patches. The process involves creating a flattened array of patches, encoding them in JSON, and sending them back to the Kubernetes API server.

Centralized management of OPA resources can be achieved using Styra DAS, which allows for centralized policy management, deployment, and logging. Styra DAS provides tools like Compliance Packs, which include predefined policy groups for security and compliance, simplifying the management process. Policies can be enforced, monitored, or ignored, and Styra DAS can integrate with Git for version control.

Styra DAS also facilitates the deployment of OPA bundles to agents, enabling centralized logging and policy management across multiple clusters. The uninstall process for Styra DAS involves removing OPA resources from the Kubernetes cluster, which can lead to connection errors visible in the Styra DAS interface.

Overall, OPA is a mature solution for policy enforcement in Kubernetes, supporting both validating and mutating admission controls. It has maintained backward compatibility while evolving with Kubernetes, making it a reliable choice for policy management.



The text discusses the use of Open Policy Agent (OPA) in Kubernetes, highlighting its flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to integrate with various tools like Styra DAS and kube-mgmt. OPA is valued for its comprehensive policy libraries and its capability to be customized through Rego, a policy language that may initially be challenging but is beneficial for those with programming backgrounds.

The text also introduces MagTape, an open-source project from T-Mobile that extends OPA using the Decorator design pattern. MagTape provides additional functionalities, such as business workflows and a notification layer integrating with Slack. It acts as a proxy between the Kubernetes API server and OPA, enhancing the user experience without altering OPA’s core functionality. However, MagTape is an older project with potential security vulnerabilities due to outdated dependencies, which should be a consideration for users.

Installation and configuration of MagTape involve downloading and modifying YAML files to address deprecated API versions and update container images. The text emphasizes the importance of setting proper ValidatingWebhookConfiguration rules and namespace labels to ensure effective policy enforcement. MagTape uses an opt-in approach for namespace validation, contrasting with the more common opt-out model in Kubernetes policy-as-code (PaC) solutions.

MagTape installation creates several resources, including ConfigMaps and a validating webhook configuration. The init container in MagTape handles TLS settings necessary for secure communications between the Kubernetes API server and the webhook services. The proxying mechanism of MagTape is implemented using a Python web application with Flask and Gunicorn, forwarding requests to OPA’s v0 REST API endpoint.

Controlling deny volumes in MagTape is managed through an environment variable, allowing users to adjust the level of denied requests without modifying policies directly. This flexibility is crucial for organizations looking to implement specific business logic while maintaining robust security and compliance controls.

Overall, the text provides insights into the integration and enhancement of OPA in Kubernetes environments, offering practical guidance on installation, configuration, and leveraging additional tools like MagTape for extended functionalities.



The text discusses the integration of MagTape with Kubernetes, focusing on loading settings from ConfigMap resources and applying policies through Open Policy Agent (OPA). MagTape policies include severity levels (LOW, MED, HIGH) and error codes, allowing for business logic integration into Kubernetes environments. The MAGTAPE_DENY_LEVEL setting controls whether policy violations stop deployments, with levels such as OFF, LOW, MED, and HIGH, determining the severity of denials. 

A key feature is the "Deny Volume Knob," which adjusts the volume of possible denials, allowing different enforcement levels across environments. For example, a LOW setting only blocks HIGH-severity requests. This flexibility supports gradual policy implementation without impeding productivity, especially in non-production environments.

Slack notifications are easily configured via the magtape-env ConfigMap, allowing alerts to be sent to a Slack workspace using a webhook. This integration provides immediate feedback on policy violations, enhancing user experience and operational awareness.

MagTape’s business-logic layer between the Policy as Code (PaC) solution and the Kubernetes API server is highlighted as a novel approach, allowing for reusable policy structures and business logic without embedding specific logic in PaC solutions. The text suggests that this pattern could be beneficial across various implementations.

However, concerns about MagTape include its lack of activity as an open-source project and absence of mutating webhook support. Additionally, the extra service layer may introduce noticeable lag, impacting system performance during load testing.

The text transitions to discussing OPA/Gatekeeper, a popular PaC solution for Kubernetes. Gatekeeper uses native Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to create policies for mutation and validation. It is a mature project with a strong community and supports features like external data providers and policy expansion.

Gatekeeper installation can be done via kubectl, Helm, or make, with Helm preferred for managing multiple resources. Post-installation checks include reviewing logs and ensuring proper execution of policies, such as a deny-all-pods constraint.

Gatekeeper employs three webhook configurations, with two set to fail open to prevent cluster disruptions if the webhook service fails. Namespace selection allows exempting certain Namespaces from validation, using labels to control which operations are ignored.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of integrating business logic with Kubernetes policy management, using tools like MagTape and Gatekeeper to enhance flexibility, enforce policies, and improve user experience.



The text outlines the installation, configuration, and management of Gatekeeper, a policy management system for Kubernetes, using Helm and shell scripting. The installation process involves setting up Gatekeeper in the `gatekeeper-system` namespace with specific configurations like logging denies, setting replicas, and defining exempt namespaces to prevent unauthorized exemptions. The text emphasizes the importance of using labels to exclude namespaces at the webhook configuration level, ensuring Gatekeeper is not called by the API server for sensitive namespaces like `kube-system`.

Gatekeeper's alpha feature allows dynamic configuration to exclude namespaces using a config resource, which still results in the API server calling Gatekeeper. This approach is less secure, as it relies on Gatekeeper's availability to make exclusion decisions, potentially compromising cluster operations if Gatekeeper fails.

Uninstallation is managed through a shell script that removes the Gatekeeper Helm installation, deletes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), and unlabels namespaces. The text highlights the necessity of explicitly uninstalling CRDs due to Helm 3's design.

Gatekeeper uses the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and its Constraint Framework (OPA CF) to create policies through ConstraintTemplates and Constraints. These resources allow for the construction of mutating and validation policies using Rego, a policy language. ConstraintTemplates define new constraint types and policies, while Constraints apply these templates to specific Kubernetes resources.

Validation policies in Gatekeeper differ from OPA classic by requiring the creation of Kubernetes resources. ConstraintTemplates create CRDs that define the structure and behavior of policies, allowing for the customization of parameters like allowed operations and registries. Constraints specify the resources and namespaces to which these policies apply, using parameters defined in the ConstraintTemplate.

Enforcement actions in Gatekeeper can be set to `deny`, `warn`, or `dryrun`, determining how violations are handled. In `warn` mode, violations are logged as warnings, while `dryrun` mode logs violations without affecting resource requests.

Mutation policies in Gatekeeper are defined using mutator CRDs like `assignmetadata.mutations.gatekeeper.sh`, which modify resource metadata. Policies specify the extent, intent, and conditional elements of mutations, such as adding metadata labels to resources in specific namespaces.

Overall, Gatekeeper provides a flexible and secure way to manage Kubernetes policies, leveraging OPA for policy definition and enforcement while allowing for detailed customization through ConstraintTemplates and Constraints.



The text discusses the application of Gatekeeper mutation policies in Kubernetes, focusing on labeling and annotating Pods, and using Assign mutation policies to manage security contexts like `seccompProfile`. It highlights the importance of verifying mutations with validation policies to ensure correct application.

The process involves using `kubectl` commands to apply and verify labels and annotations. For example, after applying a Pod resource, labels such as `app`, `billing`, `env`, and `owner` are verified. Similarly, annotations related to Gatekeeper mutations are checked to ensure correct application.

The Assign mutator example illustrates a policy to add a `seccompProfile` if it's missing, using a conditional section to ensure it doesn't overwrite existing settings. The policy requires the `subPath` to be a prefix of the `location` field, otherwise, an error occurs. The `spec.match.scope` field defaults to `*`, but can be set to `Namespaced` for specific resource matching.

The text also delves into a multitenancy isolation use case, aiming to isolate workloads in Kubernetes by using node taints, Pod tolerations, node labels, and Pod-to-Node affinities. Node taints prevent unwanted Pods from running on specific nodes, while tolerations allow certain Pods to run on tainted nodes. Affinities attract Pods to specific nodes, achieving Namespace-to-nodegroup isolation.

Steps to implement this include creating a Kubernetes cluster with multiple nodegroups, tainting and labeling nodes, and writing mutation and validation policies to manage node affinities and tolerations. Validation policies ensure correct application and prevent unauthorized usage of tolerations.

Gatekeeper's audit mode evaluates preexisting resource configurations with Constraints, identifying violations not caught during webhook processes. Audit settings can be configured to control the audit process, and violations are logged, providing insights into policy adherence.

External data providers in Gatekeeper allow policies to access data outside Kubernetes, enabling more complex policy decisions. These providers are configured with TLS settings to ensure secure communication.

Overall, the text emphasizes the integration of mutation and validation policies in Kubernetes for resource management, multitenancy isolation, and policy auditing, highlighting the importance of secure and efficient resource configuration and management.



The text outlines the process of configuring Kubernetes using templates, secrets, and external data providers with Gatekeeper, a policy management tool for Kubernetes. It details the use of shell commands to replace placeholders in YAML templates with environment-specific values and apply configurations using `kubectl`. The setup involves creating and applying configurations for namespaces, applications, and providers, as well as managing TLS secrets.

Gatekeeper integrates with Kubernetes by intercepting API requests and forwarding them to an external data provider, which responds with decisions that Gatekeeper uses to enforce policies. The example provided illustrates a Golang HTTP server that mimics a Magic 8 Ball, providing random responses to demonstrate external data policy testing.

A ConstraintTemplate is used to define policies that interact with external data providers. It sends container image URIs to the external provider and validates responses. If errors are detected, the request is denied. This setup is used to test policies by simulating different scenarios through request and response payloads.

The text also discusses the use of external data providers for mutation and validation policies, highlighting the importance of caching to reduce network traffic. Gatekeeper’s external data cache, introduced in version 3.13.0, helps minimize unnecessary data requests by caching responses.

Policy expansion is another feature discussed, which allows Pod policies to be applied to workloads that create Pods, such as Deployments and DaemonSets. This is achieved through the ExpansionTemplate CRD, which expands policies to cover these workloads, simplifying policy management.

The gator CLI is introduced as a tool for testing Gatekeeper policies. It uses test suites to verify policies against known-good and known-bad scenarios, helping ensure policy correctness before deployment. This CLI integrates well with CI processes, providing a mechanism for automated policy validation.

Overall, Gatekeeper serves as a facade over OPA, offering additional functionalities like external data providers, policy expansion, and CLI tools to enhance Kubernetes policy management. It leverages Rego for policy definition but extends its capabilities through CRDs, allowing for flexible and expressive policy configurations.

The text transitions into a brief introduction to Kyverno, a policy engine designed specifically for Kubernetes, which uses YAML for policy definitions instead of Rego. Kyverno aims to simplify policy management by leveraging familiar Kubernetes syntax, reducing the learning curve for Kubernetes users.

Kyverno integrates with Kubernetes using dynamic admission controllers, similar to other solutions, and is supported by an active community. It offers a policy library and documentation to assist users in adopting and implementing policies within their Kubernetes environments.



The text provides a detailed guide on installing, configuring, and using Kyverno, a Kubernetes policy engine. Installation can be done via Helm or kubectl, with Helm offering more customization. The installation process includes setting up CRDs, admission controllers, and other components, with warnings about optimal settings for production environments. High availability (HA) configurations are recommended for production to ensure reliability.

Kyverno uses a compatibility matrix to match its versions with Kubernetes versions. The installation process involves automating with Makefile and shell scripts. Post-installation, it’s essential to verify mutating webhook configurations and ensure that Kyverno’s webhooks are properly set up to ignore certain sensitive Namespaces like `kube-system` to avoid compromising cluster operations.

Dynamic webhook configurations in Kyverno help reduce unnecessary API server traffic by only provisioning webhooks when needed. Resource filters can be configured to skip processing certain resources, which is crucial for maintaining efficient cluster operations.

Uninstallation is straightforward using a Helm command. Kyverno provides a policy library and a Playground for testing policies. Policies are written in YAML and leverage JMESPath for complex field selections and conditions. YAML anchors allow for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology, making policies more efficient and easier to manage.

Policies in Kyverno are composed of rules, patterns, and actions. Rules specify how policies match resources and execute actions to control cluster behavior. Patterns are used to match resources, while actions define the policy’s response upon matching. Policies can validate, mutate, clean up, generate resources, or verify images.

The policy lexicon includes JMESPath for querying and YAML anchors for conditional processing. JMESPath expressions allow for more expressive policies, enabling complex conditions and selections. YAML anchors facilitate conditional logic, ensuring that specific fields meet certain criteria before applying actions.

Kyverno policies use metadata for additional information, such as supported versions and policy subjects. This metadata is primarily for documentation and does not affect Kyverno’s functionality directly. Overall, the text emphasizes best practices for installing, configuring, and managing Kyverno to ensure efficient and secure Kubernetes operations.



Kyverno offers five main policy types: Mutate, Validate, CleanUp, Generate, and VerifyImages, each scoped as cluster-wide or Namespace-specific. ClusterPolicy resources (cpol) and Namespace-scoped policies (pol) are based on distinct CRDs. 

**Mutate Policies**: These adjust inbound API server requests before validation. They can add labels to various resources, patch Namespace resources with annotations, or replace deprecated image registries. Mutation can target existing resources, triggered by CREATE or UPDATE operations. For instance, a policy can mutate Namespaces, excluding specific ones like kube-system, by using `mutateExistingOnPolicyUpdate`.

**Validate Policies**: These are the most common and start with an action for violations. They use multiple rule types, including patterns, CEL expressions, and deny conditions. For example, a policy can audit Namespace changes labeled with privileged profiles unless made by cluster-admins. Validation can also deny requests, e.g., blocking DELETE operations on resources managed by Kyverno.

**Policy Auto-Gen**: This feature simplifies policy writing for Pods by generating rules for workloads that create Pods, such as Deployments. By writing a single Pod rule, Auto-Gen produces corresponding rules for related workloads, enhancing the user experience and reducing policy management complexity.

**Time-Bound Policies**: These activate during specified times, such as maintenance windows, using UTC-based scheduling. They can enforce rules like denying Pod operations during certain hours.

**Common Expression Language (CEL) Policies**: Kyverno supports CEL expressions for validation, allowing complex conditions. For instance, a policy can restrict seccomp profiles at both Pod and container levels to specific types.

**VerifyImages Policies**: These ensure only OCI images with verified signatures are used, enhancing Kubernetes security. They support signature verification through tools like Sigstore Cosign and CNCF Notary, securing the software supply chain.

Kyverno policies, through their diverse types and features, provide a robust framework for managing Kubernetes security and compliance, offering tools for mutation, validation, auto-generation, and image verification to streamline and secure cluster operations.



The Kyverno documentation provides detailed guidance on using VerifyImages policies with OCI images signed using Cosign. A ClusterPolicy example illustrates how to enforce image signature verification using public keys. The `mutateDigest` field replaces image tags with immutable digests, ensuring image integrity. Attestors, like public keys, verify images, while Notary certificates can also be used. Image digests, created with SHA-256, ensure integrity, as tags can be mutable.

Kyverno's generation policies automate resource creation, such as NetworkPolicy resources for new Namespaces. A deny-all policy is recommended to restrict network traffic, allowing only necessary ingress and egress. Policies can apply to existing resources using `generateExisting: true`. Generated resources can be linked to their triggers with `synchronize: true`, ensuring they are deleted with the original resource.

A ClusterPolicy example demonstrates creating a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) alongside a Deployment. Permissions for the Kyverno background controller must be configured to manage PDB resources, using ClusterRole aggregation for RBAC. Generation policies can also clone resources from a central Namespace, useful for resources like ConfigMaps and Secrets.

CleanUp policies, introduced in Kyverno v1.9.0, automate cluster housekeeping using CronJobs. These policies cannot use certain match and exclude items due to the lack of API server context. A ClusterCleanupPolicy example uses JMESPath to identify and remove Deployments with fewer than two replicas, running every five minutes. ClusterRole aggregation is used to manage permissions for cleanup tasks.

Kyverno supports dynamic policy exclusions using ConfigMaps, allowing for flexible management of excluded Namespaces. The `exclude` rule can dynamically reference a list from a ConfigMap. Policy exceptions, an alpha feature in Kyverno v1.9.0, allow specific resources to bypass policy rules without modifying the rules themselves. Exceptions can be temporary, managed by generation and cleanup policies.

Policy exceptions are enabled with Helm flags and allow specific rules to be bypassed for designated resources. This feature simplifies the exclusion process, avoiding changes to Namespace labels or policy rules. Exceptions can be linked to cleanup policies for automatic removal, ensuring temporary exceptions are managed efficiently.

These Kyverno features enhance security and compliance by automating policy management and resource generation, while cleanup policies maintain cluster hygiene. Policy exceptions provide flexibility, allowing temporary deviations from standard policies without extensive modifications.



Kyverno provides a robust policy engine for Kubernetes, enabling users to write policies in YAML, which simplifies adoption and reduces the learning curve. Key features include mutation, validation, and background scanning policies, which allow for automated compliance, housekeeping, and impact analysis. PolicyReports, based on CRDs and CNCF standards, offer human- and machine-readable outputs that describe policy execution against resources, aiding in compliance and auditability.

Background scans, enabled by default, apply policies to existing resources, allowing for retrospective policy application and periodic re-evaluation. This feature is crucial for impact analysis and compensates for webhook call failures. Users can disable background scans at the policy level if needed.

Kyverno CLI facilitates policy testing, both with and without a Kubernetes cluster, supporting CI automation. It allows for dry-run operations against resources, providing a mechanism to evaluate policy impacts without affecting live environments. The CLI can be installed via kubectl krew or as a standalone binary.

Policy testing involves creating test configurations to apply mutating and validating policies, defining scenarios for pass or fail outcomes. The Kyverno CLI automates these tests, ensuring policies behave as expected. It also supports dry-run evaluations, generating PolicyReports for existing cluster resources to assess the impact of new policies.

Kyverno's policy library and Playground assist users in prototyping and troubleshooting policies. The solution supports VerifyImages policies, enabling users to validate OCI image provenance, and offers policy exceptions for excluding resources from policy processing.

The Kyverno Policy Reporter provides a user interface for viewing policy reports and compliance data, enhancing usability. Kyverno's maturity and extensive community support, along with enterprise solutions from Nirmata, make it a compelling choice for Kubernetes policy as code (PaC) needs.

Overall, Kyverno excels in traditional Kubernetes use cases and extends to scenarios not covered by other PaC solutions. Its integration into CI processes and the ability to manage policies across multiple resources make it a versatile tool for Kubernetes administrators. With over a billion downloads, Kyverno's adoption continues to grow within the Kubernetes community.

In contrast, jsPolicy leverages JavaScript for Kubernetes policies, aligning with organizations familiar with JavaScript ecosystems. This approach minimizes disruptions by utilizing existing language capabilities, making it an attractive alternative for teams with JavaScript expertise.



**jsPolicy Overview**

jsPolicy is a Policy as Code (PaC) solution using JavaScript as its native language, leveraging the familiarity of JavaScript to reduce learning curves and boost productivity. It utilizes the V8 JavaScript engine for performance optimization. Installation of jsPolicy in Kubernetes involves using Helm and is straightforward, although it currently lacks support for Linux/ARM64 architecture.

**Installation Process**

To install jsPolicy, a shell script is used to automate the setup with Helm. The script handles namespace labeling to avoid conflicts. After installation, validation is performed using `kubectl` commands to check deployments and logs. Five Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed by jsPolicy, which are crucial for its operation.

**Webhook Configuration**

jsPolicy uses a unique approach to webhook configurations, registering a webhook for each ingested policy rather than reusing configurations for multiple policies. This granularity allows precise control over policy application, enabling policies to target specific resources and operations. The webhook setup involves configurations for mutating and validating policies, with each pointing to the jsPolicy service.

**Policy Ingestion and Management**

Policies in jsPolicy can be inline or bundled. Inline policies embed JavaScript directly into YAML documents, while bundled policies use compressed and encoded JavaScript. The policy ingestion process involves compiling and bundling JavaScript, with successful compilation indicated in the jsPolicy resource status. Errors during compilation are detailed in the status field.

**Inline Policies**

Inline policies allow direct JavaScript embedding. For example, a policy can deny Pod creation if it contains a specific annotation. This is achieved using JavaScript functions like `deny()` and optional chaining for property access. The policy logic is embedded within the YAML, and the namespace and object selectors are used to match requests.

**Uninstallation**

Uninstalling jsPolicy is handled via a Helm command, with additional steps to remove persistent CRDs. This process is straightforward and ensures a clean removal of all jsPolicy components.

**Conclusion**

jsPolicy offers a flexible and familiar environment for Kubernetes policy management using JavaScript. Its detailed webhook configuration and policy ingestion processes provide granular control over policy application, making it a powerful tool for Kubernetes administrators.



The text discusses the implementation and management of policies in Kubernetes using jsPolicy, focusing on mutating, validating, and controller policies. It emphasizes the importance of configuring webhook and API server request timeouts for optimal latency. Mutating policies, like the example provided, copy namespace labels to pods, removing irrelevant ones. This is achieved using JavaScript within the policy configuration. The jsPolicyBundle resource is created for mutating policies, similar to the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration resource for validating policies.

Controller policies, unlike mutating and validating ones, are event-based and do not participate in the Kubernetes API server request flow. They react to cluster-state changes, similar to Kyverno Generate policies, and can automate resource creation, such as network policies, when namespaces are labeled appropriately. Controller policies are useful for automating the creation of namespace-scoped resources in multi-tenant environments, though they may conflict with GitOps principles.

Troubleshooting controller policies can be complex due to the lack of user information in policy violations, as they do not execute as webhook calls. The text provides examples of logs and jsPolicyViolation resources for troubleshooting errors.

The document also covers the use of JavaScript and TypeScript for policy development, leveraging tools like npm for building and managing policies outside the Kubernetes cluster. The process involves compiling and bundling policies using the jsPolicy SDK and npm, though vulnerabilities in dependencies can pose challenges.

jsPolicy supports inline and bundled policies, with inline policies allowing quick prototyping using YAML and JavaScript. Bundled policies offer a more structured approach, suitable for organizations with established JavaScript or TypeScript practices. The text notes that jsPolicy may not be as mature as other solutions, based on project activity and community participation, but it offers an accessible entry point for JavaScript developers.

Overall, jsPolicy provides a flexible framework for managing Kubernetes policies, with the potential for reduced disruption in organizations familiar with JavaScript tooling. The text expresses cautious optimism about jsPolicy's future development and adoption.

The upcoming chapter will explore Cloud Custodian as a Kubernetes Policy as Code (PaC) solution, highlighting its origins in cloud computing infrastructure management.



In 2016, Capital One sought tools for cloud governance in AWS, leading to the adoption of Cloud Custodian (c7n). Initially designed for AWS, c7n extended support to Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes. Written in Python, c7n leverages the Python ecosystem, with its policy language based on YAML, similar to Kubernetes API schemas.

**CLI and Installation**  
c7n offers a CLI for interfacing with Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to apply policies that report and modify resources. Installation involves setting up a Python virtual environment, ensuring isolation from system configurations. After activation, c7n core and Kubernetes plugin are installed using pip, verifying functionality through version checks.

**Policies and Filters**  
c7n policies, written in YAML, utilize filters to select resources. For example, a policy can filter Pods with a specific label without taking action. Running such a policy involves starting a Pod and executing the policy to gather information. Output files generated include logs, metadata, and resource descriptions. Disabling the default 15-minute cache ensures policies work with current resources, crucial during testing.

**Policies with Actions**  
Actions can be added to c7n policies to modify resources. A policy might delete Pods with a specific label. Testing involves a dry-run to assess impact without execution, followed by an actual run to delete selected Pods. Outputs are organized by policy name, showing execution details and resource modifications.

**Discovery and Resource Schema**  
c7n policies help discover how resources are represented. Writing a policy without filters or actions can collect data on all Pods, revealing object models. For instance, the securityContext in Pods is represented as `spec.security_context` in the c7n model. This understanding aids in crafting policies to detect missing securityContexts in Pods and containers.

**Advanced Policy Crafting**  
Policies can include logical operations like NOT to reverse filters. For instance, a policy can select Pods where containers lack securityContexts and apply actions like labeling or annotating. This approach can be extended to check for misconfigured elements and refine resource management in Kubernetes clusters.

Cloud Custodian's flexibility and integration with Kubernetes offer powerful tools for cloud governance, enabling precise control over resources through well-defined policies.



The text discusses the integration of Cloud Custodian (c7n) with Kubernetes, focusing on using c7n-kube for policy management through dynamic admission controllers. The primary goal is to enhance security by ensuring that Kubernetes Pods adhere to specific policies, such as having necessary labels or security contexts.

### c7n-kube Policies
- **Security Context Policy**: Identifies Pods lacking a securityContext element and patches them with compliance labels and annotations. 
- **Controller Mode**: Utilizes Kubernetes dynamic admission controllers, specifically mutating webhooks, to enforce policies. The webhook configuration is set to ignore failures, allowing changes if the webhook call is unsuccessful.

### Installation and Configuration
- **Helm Installation**: The initial setup faced issues due to outdated documentation, but these were resolved using updated values from the GitHub repository.
- **Cert Manager**: Automates TLS certificate creation for secure communication between the Kubernetes API server and the webhook service.
- **Namespace Selector**: Implements an opt-in model where only namespaces with specific labels are monitored.

### Policies in Controller Mode
- **Warn and Deny Policies**: Two policies were installed—one to warn on all Pod creations/updates and another to deny Pods missing required labels.
- **Mutating Policies**: Current support is limited; for example, the patch action isn't supported. Policies are modified by editing the configmap, requiring a controller restart to apply changes.

### c7n-kates
- **Functionality**: Acts as a Python-based server handling Kubernetes API requests via admission control webhooks. It can operate both inside and outside of Kubernetes clusters, offering flexibility across multiple clusters.
- **Implementation**: The server can be started externally, allowing it to handle admission requests. This setup is advantageous for prototyping and troubleshooting.

### Challenges and Community Support
- The c7n-kube tools are less mature compared to the overall c7n project, with documentation sometimes lacking depth. However, the community and contributors are responsive to queries.

### Conclusion
Cloud Custodian's integration with Kubernetes through c7n-kube offers a unified approach for cloud and Kubernetes policy management. While the Kubernetes-specific features are still maturing, the tool leverages the existing strengths of Cloud Custodian, providing a familiar environment for users. The ability to run c7n-kates externally adds flexibility, although the lack of a separate validating admission controller is a deviation from Kubernetes standards.

Overall, c7n-kube represents a promising step for those already familiar with Cloud Custodian, looking to extend their policy management capabilities into Kubernetes environments.



In Chapter 11, the focus shifts from Kubernetes to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Policy as Code (PaC), particularly in the context of AWS. The chapter emphasizes the significance of Kubernetes API server request flow, which integrates mutating and validating webhooks to apply preventive controls. This functionality is critical for maintaining preventive controls, a relatively unique feature across platforms.

IaC is defined as managing datacenter resources in a testable, auditable, and reproducible manner, akin to application deployment. It is popular due to its human and machine readability, working with both cloud and bare-metal resources. A key best practice in IaC is immutability, which prevents in-place modifications of resources. Instead, changes are made by updating IaC artifacts, creating new resource versions to replace existing ones. This approach mitigates issues like drift, which can occur from manual changes or outdated IaC artifacts.

The chapter contrasts "baking" and "frying" in IaC. Baking involves starting with a complete configuration or image to build a resource, minimizing errors and drift. Conversely, frying entails incremental configuration, which can introduce variability and errors. As practices matured, baking became preferred, focusing on application availability and performance rather than server uptime.

IaC can be implemented using imperative or declarative programming. Imperative IaC involves defining steps to achieve a goal using languages like Java or Python, often with SDKs for cloud service providers (CSPs). Declarative IaC involves defining the desired state of resources using structured data languages like JSON or YAML, processed by tools like eksctl or AWS CloudFormation.

The chapter highlights the use of PaC for applying controls—security, compliance, governance, and best practices—to IaC resources. Controls are categorized as preventive, detective, and reactive. Preventive controls act as guardrails, stopping noncompliant behaviors before they occur. Detective controls record and catalog issues, while reactive controls respond to changes post-occurrence, potentially acting as preventive controls if they react quickly.

Preventive controls are emphasized, with examples using Open Policy Agent (OPA) to validate IaC artifacts. Declarative JSON and YAML facilitate PaC validation, enabling the application of preventive controls. The chapter illustrates this with an OPA policy for verifying Amazon EKS configurations, demonstrating how Rego, the policy language for OPA, can be used to enforce compliance.

Styra's Regal tool is introduced as a Rego linter, helping to write better Rego policies. Regal identifies issues like formatting and idiomatic usage, promoting best practices in policy writing.

Overall, the chapter underscores the importance of IaC and PaC in modern infrastructure management, advocating for immutable practices, declarative programming, and effective control mechanisms to enhance security, compliance, and operational efficiency.



The text discusses the use of Policy as Code (PaC) tools for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) validation, focusing on Regal, OPA, Conftest, Checkov, and AWS CloudFormation (CFN) Hooks.

**Regal and Configuration:**
Regal is a linting tool that checks Rego policies for idiomatic use and import practices. It allows customization through a configuration file, where users can set rule levels (error, ignore, warning) and specify files to ignore. Regal integrates with IDEs like VS Code for real-time feedback.

**OPA and Conftest:**
OPA (Open Policy Agent) is used for validating IaC by executing policies against input documents. The `opa exec` command can be used to validate configurations, returning detailed results. Conftest, built on OPA, simplifies policy execution by using default conventions, reducing configuration complexity. It supports both JSON and YAML inputs and offers flexibility in specifying policy paths and namespaces.

**Checkov:**
Checkov is a static code analysis tool for IaC that checks for security and compliance issues. It uses Python-based policies and integrates with automation pipelines. Checkov can validate AWS CloudFormation templates, identifying issues like unrestricted security group ingress. However, Checkov requires well-formed YAML or JSON inputs to function correctly.

**Linting with cfn-lint:**
Before using PaC tools, IaC artifacts should be linted to ensure syntax correctness. cfn-lint is used for AWS CloudFormation templates to detect syntax errors, providing detailed feedback on issues.

**AWS CFN Hooks:**
AWS CFN Hooks are preventive controls that validate resources within the AWS CFN service. Introduced in 2022, they allow for resource-validation decisions close to the system under change. Hooks are registered with AWS CFN and can handle actions like CREATE, DELETE, and UPDATE on specified resources. The AWS CFN hook architecture involves running hooks in the AWS CFN service account, not the customer account.

**Integrating PaC with Hooks:**
To avoid duplicative custom solutions, integrating a general-purpose PaC tool like OPA with AWS CFN hooks is recommended. This integration can centralize validation logic, promoting reusability and reducing complexity. The OPA server can be used by multiple hooks to validate various AWS resources and actions.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of integrating PaC tools into the DevSecOps pipeline for proactive IaC validation, ensuring compliance and security while minimizing manual intervention.



The text discusses the use of Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy-as-code (PaC) solutions in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments, focusing on AWS CloudFormation (CFN) and Terraform. A central OPA server can handle multiple validations, reducing the need for custom AWS CFN hooks. This server is hosted on Amazon EKS for enhanced features like logging and scaling. Secure communication between AWS CFN hooks and the OPA server is established using AWS Secrets Manager to store authentication tokens.

The process involves starting the OPA server with authorization settings and registering AWS CFN hooks using AWS CLI commands. These hooks use stored secrets as bearer tokens to authenticate with the OPA server. The text also covers the use of Conftest and Rego policies for validating Terraform artifacts.

Terraform is highlighted as a popular cross-platform IaC tool with a large community and extensive library of modules. Its configuration language, HCL, is parsed into JSON for validation. The process involves initializing a Terraform project, creating a plan, and converting it to JSON. Rego policies are then written to validate this JSON, focusing on aspects like EKS version and AWS region.

Conftest simplifies validation by parsing HCL files directly, avoiding manual JSON manipulation. It supports over 20 file formats, making it versatile for different IaC scenarios. The text also introduces the use of OPA's built-in Terraform plan features, allowing policies to address Terraform's HCL structure directly.

Styra, the creator of OPA, offers additional tools like the Styra DAS Terraform System Type, which acts on Terraform files without needing conversion. Terraform Cloud also supports OPA policies for policy enforcement.

The summary emphasizes the shift towards declarative IaC practices, focusing on PaC solutions to control changes. It discusses the types of controls—detective, preventive, and reactive—and their roles in IaC. OPA's general-purpose nature makes it suitable for IaC validation, with tools like Conftest and Checkov providing predefined policies and reducing cognitive load.

In conclusion, the text explores the integration of OPA with AWS CFN and Terraform, showcasing how PaC solutions enhance IaC by validating configurations and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.



In this chapter, the focus is on Policy as Code (PaC) and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) validation using Terraform, particularly within AWS, and extending to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The chapter discusses the use of HashiCorp Sentinel, a PaC language developed to validate Terraform artifacts, designed for ease of use by both programmers and non-programmers. Sentinel policies consist of rules, functions, variables, and parameters, with the main rule requiring at least one boolean operand. Sentinel's CLI and Playground facilitate policy application and testing.

The chapter outlines Terraform's role in maintaining infrastructure states and introduces Terraform Cloud (TFC) for enhanced integration, automation, and data management. Key Terraform artifacts include `tfplan` (plan for state maintenance), `tfconfig` (data from `.tf` files), `tfstate` (recorded infrastructure state), and `tfrun` (run data). Sentinel policies can validate these artifacts, though their data models vary, necessitating the use of mocking for testing.

Mocking involves creating realistic data structures for policy validation. The chapter provides a process for generating mock data using TFC and GitHub integration. This includes storing Terraform projects in GitHub, creating TFC accounts and projects, and configuring workspaces linked to GitHub repositories. The TFC setup allows for speculative plans and downloading Sentinel mocks for policy testing.

Sentinel policies can be configured using the `sentinel.hcl` file, specifying paths to mock data, policy sources, enforcement levels, and execution parameters. Sentinel supports three enforcement levels: advisory (warnings), soft mandatory (pass unless overridden), and mandatory (must pass).

The chapter also explores the use of functions in Sentinel policies for more powerful and flexible validation compared to simple rules. Functions can iterate over collections, validate conditions, and provide detailed logging. The example provided demonstrates a policy validating Amazon EKS clusters, using functions to identify and report invalid versions.

Testing is crucial for Terraform projects, with the chapter highlighting various testing types: unit testing (isolated components), integration testing (code integration), compliance testing (conformance to policies), and end-to-end testing (system functionality under load). The focus is on compliance testing, ensuring infrastructure adheres to defined policies.

Overall, the chapter emphasizes the importance of using PaC for IaC validation, leveraging tools like Sentinel for effective policy management, and integrating with platforms like TFC for streamlined infrastructure management and testing.



In applying the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) to Terraform projects, multiple testing types are used, including unit testing of Sentinel policies. Best practices for unit-testing Sentinel policies include writing policies for specific controls, using Sentinel modules for DRY practices, employing both pass and fail tests with different data mocks, and maintaining consistent directory structures. Sentinel testing is facilitated by a built-in framework similar to OPA, using directory conventions for organizing policy projects with mock data and tests.

To connect Terraform Cloud (TFC) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using dynamic credentials, the GCP Workload Identity Provider is used, enabling external applications to use short-lived credentials. This involves logging into GCP for local development with Application Default Credentials (ADC) and configuring the necessary credentials and environment variables in the TFC workspace for speculative plans.

A Sentinel policy example, `required-labels.sentinel`, demonstrates how to validate Google Storage bucket labels using imports and functions like `list_in_list` to ensure required label names are present. Sentinel tests are organized into directories matching policy filenames, using specific data mocks to drive pass or fail tests. The `sentinel test` command verifies policy behavior, and the `-verbose` flag provides detailed output.

Terraform Cloud (TFC) supports policies and policy sets at the organization level, enabling Sentinel or OPA policies to evaluate Terraform artifacts. Policies can be loaded from remote repositories, reducing local execution toil. Terraform validation includes unit, integration, compliance, and end-to-end testing to ensure no unwanted or unsecured resources are introduced. Tools like Cloud Custodian and Prowler can verify infrastructure changes post-apply.

Several tools complement Sentinel for Terraform IaC validation:

1. **Checkov**: Python-based, evaluates Terraform IaC for issues like public access prevention and bucket versioning.
2. **Tflint**: A Golang framework for linting Terraform, identifying issues like missing `required_version` attributes.
3. **Terrascan**: Golang-based, performs static code analysis on Terraform IaC, identifying violations like missing uniform bucket-level access.
4. **Tfsec**: OSS security scanner, detects misconfigurations leading to security issues, such as disabled uniform bucket-level access and lack of customer-managed encryption keys.

These tools are evaluated based on criteria like open-source status, ease of installation, extensibility, and output readability. They help catch issues before Terraform plans or applies are executed, supporting a comprehensive defense-in-depth security strategy.
