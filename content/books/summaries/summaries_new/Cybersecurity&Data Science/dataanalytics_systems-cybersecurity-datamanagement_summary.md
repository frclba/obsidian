The book targets three professions: project managers, systems engineers, and cybersecurity professionals. Each role requires data analytics skills to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with stakeholders. The text aims to refresh and enhance these skills, avoiding elementary statistics while focusing on critical thinking and model building. The use of Occam’s Razor is reiterated to prioritize simplicity in analytics.

A clear definition of "data" is provided, emphasizing its role in analysis rather than verification. The text references the CRISP-DM method, a standard in data mining, which assumes data from reputable sources like federal websites is pre-validated.

Data types are categorized into quantitative and qualitative, with further subdivisions. Quantitative data includes discrete and continuous types, essential for statistical analysis and model building. Qualitative data, such as categorical or nominal, often requires transformation into quantitative measures for analysis. The text warns against arbitrary transformations that can lead to misleading conclusions.

Quantitative values provide clarity and context, as demonstrated with COVID-19 data examples, showing how raw numbers can mislead without proper context. Analysts are responsible for understanding data types and their implications on analysis.

Qualitative data, often seen in surveys, can be transformed into quantitative measures but requires caution. The text discusses nominal and ordinal data, highlighting the potential pitfalls of assigning numerical values to qualitative categories, which can distort analysis.

The application of data types varies by context. Quantitative data is used for trends and configurations, while qualitative data addresses specific needs like surveys. The text warns against inappropriate transformations and highlights the importance of context in data interpretation.

The text concludes with a segue into statistical methods, emphasizing the importance of measures of central tendency, such as the mean, as foundational concepts for data analysis. These methods are essential for data analysts to begin with simple techniques before progressing to more complex analyses.



The mean is a central measure in data analysis, providing a quick overview of data. However, it is sensitive to outliers, which can skew results. Analysts must be cautious when removing outliers, as this affects future models. The mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values (N). Understanding this formula allows flexibility in using different statistical software.

Estimation methods, such as rounding or using the PERT method, help analysts make quick decisions. PERT involves weighting the most likely estimate more heavily than optimistic or pessimistic estimates, creating a faux normal distribution.

The geometric mean, unlike the arithmetic mean, involves multiplying values and taking the root based on N. It’s used for growth or decline metrics but fails when zeroes are present in the data.

The median, another central tendency measure, represents the physical center of data and is unaffected by outliers. It is the 50th percentile and helps identify data distribution. Calculating the median involves sorting data and finding the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two central numbers.

The mode, often overlooked, is crucial for identifying patterns, showing the most frequent value in a dataset. It’s particularly useful in visual data analysis, like tracking customer visits over time.

Data skewness occurs when data pools towards one end of a dataset. Skewness is calculated using the formula: skew = 3 * (mean – median) / standard deviation. Right or left skewing is determined by data distribution relative to the mode.

Kurtosis, not detailed here, indicates the presence of outliers or data concentration in tails rather than the center. Further information on kurtosis is available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

In summary, understanding these measures of central tendency—mean, median, mode—and concepts like skewness and kurtosis is essential for effective data analysis and interpretation.



Kurtosis is a statistical measure that provides insight into the shape of a dataset's distribution without needing graphical representation. While useful, calculating kurtosis can be time-consuming unless automated by software.

**Measures of Variation**: Understanding variation is crucial for data analysis, as it indicates the spread of data around the center. High variation suggests diverse data, while low variation implies uniformity. The significance of variation depends on the dataset's purpose.

**Variance**: This is the average of the squared differences from the mean, providing a measure of data width and revealing outliers. Calculating variance involves subtracting the mean from each value, squaring the result, summing these squares, and dividing by the number of values. Variance is foundational for calculating standard deviation and comparing datasets.

**Standard Deviation**: Derived from the variance, this measure is widely recognized but often misunderstood. It helps in assessing data spread and is crucial for the standard normal curve and Z-scores. The formula involves taking the square root of the variance. It is essential for comparing datasets and understanding data distribution.

**Standard Normal Curve vs. Normal Curve**: The standard normal curve has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, representing probabilities. A normal curve, however, reflects the dataset's actual mean and standard deviation. Understanding these curves helps in determining probabilities and comparing datasets using Z-scores.

**Other Measures of Variation**:

- **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: This measure uses absolute values instead of squares to avoid negative results. It provides an alternative to standard deviation but is also influenced by outliers.
  
- **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by outliers, making this measure useful for unbiased data analysis. It is available in data science tools like R and KNIME and is used in certain government GIS applications.

These statistical measures are vital for data analysis, offering various methods to understand data distribution and variation. Analysts can choose the appropriate method based on the dataset and analysis goals.



The text discusses key statistical concepts focusing on measures of central tendency, variation, and probability. It explains the calculation of the median and median absolute deviation (MAD), which involves taking the absolute difference between each data point and the median, ordering these differences, and finding their median. This result can be used similarly to standard deviation in a normal distribution.

The range is a basic measure of variation, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. Although simple, it can indicate the presence of outliers. The Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) is another measure of variation, calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It helps identify outliers using the IQR Rule, which considers values greater than Q3 + 1.5*IQR or less than Q1 - 1.5*IQR as outliers.

Percentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within a dataset. For example, the 90th percentile means 90% of values are below it. The 50th percentile, or median, represents the data's center. The calculation involves determining the position of a value rather than the value itself.

The Five Number Summary provides a quick overview of a dataset using the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values. This summary can be visualized with a box plot, providing insights into data distribution and potential outliers.

Probability is introduced as a fundamental concept in data analytics, essential for interpreting statistical results. The basic probability formula is the frequency of an occurrence divided by the total number of outcomes. The text also touches on the addition method in probability, used to calculate the probability of one event or another occurring, such as the probability of dying from heart disease or cancer.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of understanding these statistical tools for effective data analysis and interpretation.



The text explores fundamental concepts of probability, focusing on its application in various scenarios.
