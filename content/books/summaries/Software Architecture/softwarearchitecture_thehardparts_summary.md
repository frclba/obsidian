# Summary of Key Concepts in Software Architecture and Fitness Functions

## Introduction to Automation and Feedback in Software Development

In the early 2000s, the integration of software development and operations led to the creation of DevOps, emphasizing automation and feedback. Continuous integration replaced lengthy integration phases, allowing for rapid feedback and reducing project size-related issues. Automation of repetitive tasks, inspired by advances in technology, became crucial in both software development and operations.

## Architectural Fitness Functions

The concept of architectural fitness functions, introduced in "Building Evolutionary Architectures" by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, and Patrick Kua, provides a mechanism for objectively assessing architecture characteristics. These functions can be implemented using various tools to test architecture structure, performance, scalability, and reliability.

### Types of Fitness Functions

1. **Atomic Fitness Functions**: These handle a single architecture characteristic, such as checking for component cycles within a codebase.
   
2. **Holistic Fitness Functions**: These validate a combination of characteristics, addressing potential synergies or conflicts, like the relationship between security and performance.

### Implementation and Benefits

Fitness functions can automate governance tasks, distinguishing between architecture characteristics and domain criteria. For instance, elasticity can be tested without domain knowledge, while domain-specific tests require unit tests. Examples include using JDepend to detect component cycles and ArchUnit to govern layered architecture.

## Dynamic and Manual Fitness Functions

Fitness functions can be dynamic, adjusting based on context, such as scalability metrics. While most are automated, some require manual validation, like legal reviews. Continuous integration pipelines often accommodate these functions, ensuring they run consistently.

## Case Study: Equifax Data Breach

The Equifax data breach highlighted the importance of automated governance. A zero-day exploit in the Apache Struts framework went undetected due to manual processes. Automated fitness functions in deployment pipelines could have prevented this by identifying vulnerabilities promptly.

## The Role of Fitness Functions in Architecture

Fitness functions serve as an executable checklist for architectural principles, preventing technical debt by ensuring adherence to important practices. They act as a safeguard, similar to checklists used by professionals in critical fields, ensuring no critical steps are skipped.

## Architecture Versus Design

The book emphasizes keeping architecture and design distinct. Architects need to understand underlying principles to make informed decisions, focusing on "why" rather than "how." This approach avoids the complexity of implementation details and maintains a focus on architecture concepts.

## Conclusion

Architectural fitness functions enhance software development by providing a systematic way to enforce and validate architecture principles. They ensure that important but non-urgent principles are maintained, contributing to the long-term health and integrity of software systems.



The text discusses distributed architectures, focusing on microservices and the challenges of coupling, communication, and workflow coordination. It introduces key concepts such as synchronous and asynchronous communication, orchestrated and choreographed coordination, and atomicity versus eventual consistency. A service is defined as part of an architecture quantum, involving static and dynamic coupling.

The Sysops Squad Saga is used as a practical example to illustrate architectural concepts. Penultimate Electronics, a large electronics retailer, offers a support plan managed by the Sysops Squad, who resolve customer issues. The Sysops Squad ticketing application involves four main users: Administrators, Customers, Sysops Squad experts, and Managers. The application handles ticketing workflows, including problem ticket entry, expert assignment, and customer notifications.

The existing system is a monolithic application with various components like login, billing, customer notifications, and ticket management. The system faces issues such as lost tickets, wrong consultant assignments, and frequent crashes. These problems highlight the need for transitioning to a distributed architecture.

The Sysops Squad data model uses a single schema for tables related to customers, billing, contracts, and knowledge base articles. The architecture team aims to break up the application and move toward distributed architecture, which involves addressing both static and dynamic coupling.

Part I of the book focuses on architectural structure and coupling, covering topics like modularity, separation, and data impacts. Chapter 2 delves into discerning coupling, emphasizing the importance of trade-off analysis in architecture. The challenges of designing decoupled systems are discussed, noting that while decoupling is beneficial, it must be balanced to maintain system functionality.

The text highlights the complexity of microservices due to the bounded context philosophy, which makes transactionality a primary concern. It stresses the need for architects to perform trade-off analysis, using frameworks like the Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM) to navigate the intricacies of distributed systems.

In summary, the text provides a detailed exploration of distributed architectures, the Sysops Squad Saga as a case study, and the importance of coupling and trade-off analysis in modern software architecture.



In software architecture, trade-off analysis is crucial but challenging due to the complexity of entangled problems. Architects must first untangle these issues by identifying and analyzing the coupling between components. Coupling occurs when a change in one part of the system necessitates a change in another. Effective trade-off analysis requires understanding how these components are interdependent and the impact of changes.

Microservices architecture presents a common challenge: determining the appropriate size and communication styles for services. Proper sizing is critical, as too-small services can lead to orchestration issues, while too-large services can cause scaling problems. The book offers techniques to help architects construct trade-off analyses tailored to their unique challenges.

A key concept introduced is the "architecture quantum," which measures aspects of software architecture related to connectivity and communication. An architecture quantum is an independently deployable unit with high functional cohesion, high static coupling, and synchronous dynamic coupling. Static coupling refers to how components are interconnected through contracts, while dynamic coupling concerns runtime communication.

Independently deployable architecture quanta allow for separate deployment within a system, which is essential in microservices architectures. These quanta serve as a common language among architects, developers, and operations teams, helping them understand the scope and deployability of services. High functional cohesion ensures that each quantum models a single domain or workflow, promoting independence and reducing unnecessary coupling.

Static coupling is about how tightly components are wired together, often through contracts like REST or SOAP. Monolithic architectures typically have a single quantum due to shared databases, whereas distributed architectures may have multiple quanta if they avoid common coupling points.

Dynamic coupling involves runtime communication and is influenced by communication types (synchronous vs. asynchronous), consistency requirements (atomicity vs. eventual consistency), and coordination methods (orchestration vs. choreography). Synchronous communication requires the caller to wait for a response, while asynchronous communication allows parallel processing.

Understanding static and dynamic coupling helps architects identify and manage dependencies, optimize service granularity, and design systems that can adapt to change efficiently. The book provides practical examples and new terminology to aid in applying these concepts to real-world architectures.



Architects face significant trade-offs in service communication, affecting synchronization, error handling, transactionality, scalability, and performance. Asynchronous communication is commonly implemented via message queues, but architects can also use various libraries or frameworks. The choice between synchronous and asynchronous communication impacts consistency and coordination, influencing architecture's transactional integrity and workflow complexity.

Consistency ranges from atomic transactions to eventual consistency, with cross-service transactions being particularly challenging. Coordination involves orchestration and choreography, essential for complex workflows. These factors—communication, consistency, and coordination—interact, forming a three-dimensional space of dynamic quantum coupling. Architects must understand these forces to make informed decisions.

Static quantum coupling refers to the dependencies required to bootstrap a service, such as frameworks and libraries. Dynamic coupling involves how services communicate, impacting performance, scale, and elasticity. For instance, asynchronous calls using message queues can decouple services, allowing independent operation and scalability.

The concept of architecture quantum defines a bounded context in architectural terms, identifying static and dynamic coupling types. Static coupling focuses on service dependencies, while dynamic coupling concerns communication methods and their effects on operational characteristics like performance and scalability.

Architectural modularity involves breaking monolithic applications into smaller parts to enhance scalability, agility, and extensibility, crucial for adapting to business and technical changes. This modularity supports strategic goals, such as handling increased user volume from mergers or acquisitions. By distributing application components, systems can better manage resources and facilitate rapid changes.

In summary, understanding and managing communication, consistency, coordination, and coupling are vital for architects to design adaptable and scalable systems. Architectural modularity further aids in aligning systems with evolving business and technical environments.



Architectural modularity offers significant benefits such as scalability and agility, enabling businesses to respond swiftly to changes. Agility is crucial for survival in today's fast-paced market, requiring technology to match business speed. Modularity should be driven by clear business needs like speed-to-market and competitive advantage. Speed-to-market is achieved through agility, encompassing maintainability, testability, and deployability. Competitive advantage combines speed-to-market with scalability and fault tolerance.

Modularity doesn't always mean distributed architectures; monolithic architectures can also be modular. For example, modular monoliths and microkernel architectures offer structured component organization, enhancing maintainability. Maintainability involves ease of adding, changing, or removing features, with metrics like component coupling and cohesion being indicators. Large monolithic systems often suffer from low maintainability due to tight coupling and weak cohesion.

Modular architectures improve maintainability by partitioning domains into smaller, separately deployed units, making changes easier. For instance, microservices architecture isolates changes to specific services, increasing maintainability. Testability, the ease and completeness of testing, is essential for agility. Monolithic architectures face challenges in testability due to large deployment scopes. Modularity reduces testing scope, improving testability, though increased inter-service communication can reduce it.

Deployability involves ease, frequency, and risk of deployment. Modular architectures support frequent deployments with less risk, unlike monolithic systems that require extensive deployment ceremonies. However, excessive service communication can hinder deployability. Scalability, the ability to handle increasing user loads, and elasticity, responsiveness to spikes in load, are enhanced by modularity. Monolithic architectures struggle with scalability due to application-level scaling needs, whereas microservices offer function-level scalability.

Fault tolerance, the system's ability to remain operational as parts fail, is crucial. Monolithic systems have low fault tolerance, but modular architectures isolate failures, maintaining system functionality. Asynchronous communication between services enhances fault tolerance. Addison and Austen, in a business case, identified maintainability and testability as key issues in their monolithic system, advocating for modularity to address these problems by decoupling code and isolating functionality.

In summary, architectural modularity improves agility, maintainability, testability, deployability, scalability, and fault tolerance, supporting business competitiveness and responsiveness in dynamic markets.



Addison and Austen discussed the challenges of maintaining the Sysops Squad's monolithic application, which suffers from issues like incomplete testing, long deployment times, and customer dissatisfaction due to system crashes and freezes. Addison highlighted that over 30% of test cases were obsolete or missing, and the monolithic nature required deploying the entire system for small changes, increasing risk and delay. They proposed breaking the application into separately deployed services to improve testability and deployability, allowing more frequent, smaller updates with reduced bugs.

Addison and Austen also noted that customer dissatisfaction stemmed from system unavailability and crashes, not due to core ticketing functionality, but issues with customer survey and reporting features. By isolating these functions into separate services, they aimed to enhance system reliability and fault tolerance. They identified scalability and database load issues as causes for system freezes, suggesting that segregating reporting into its own system would alleviate these problems and improve scalability for customer-facing functions.

The decision was made to migrate to a distributed architecture, promising better availability, scalability, agility, and reduced bugs. However, this would delay new feature introductions and incur additional costs. Despite these challenges, the business sponsors approved the migration plan.

To tackle the monolithic application, Addison and Austen considered starting with reporting functionality but realized a more strategic approach was needed. Logan advised against the unstructured "Elephant Migration Anti-Pattern" and recommended either tactical forking or component-based decomposition. The choice depended on whether the codebase was structured or a "big ball of mud."

Component-based decomposition involves extracting components incrementally, while tactical forking entails creating replicas and removing unwanted parts. The decision relies on the codebase's structure, using metrics like afferent and efferent coupling, abstractness, and instability to evaluate its decomposability. These metrics help determine the internal structure and potential for successful decomposition.

In conclusion, migrating to a distributed architecture was seen as a necessary step to address the Sysops Squad's operational and customer satisfaction issues, with careful consideration of the codebase's structure and the appropriate decomposition strategy.



### Summary of Architectural Decomposition Techniques

In software architecture, restructuring a monolithic application into a distributed architecture, such as microservices, involves careful consideration of component balance. Components that are too abstract or too concrete can enter the "zone of uselessness" or the "zone of pain," respectively. Tools and metrics help architects assess codebases for restructuring, especially when dealing with technical debt.

#### Component-Based Decomposition

Component-based decomposition is a strategic approach to transition monolithic applications to distributed architectures. It focuses on defining components as building blocks with specific roles and operations. These components are often organized through namespaces or directory structures. The goal is to refactor the source code into well-defined components that can evolve into services, facilitating the migration to service-based or microservices architectures.

Service-based architecture, a hybrid of microservices, breaks applications into domain services, allowing for coarse-grained deployment without immediate database decomposition or operational automation. This approach is technically focused, minimizing the need for organizational changes.

#### Tactical Forking

Tactical forking, named by Fausto De La Torre, is a pragmatic method for restructuring chaotic codebases. Instead of extracting components, this approach involves cloning the entire monolith and having teams delete unnecessary code. This method is beneficial for tightly coupled systems, as it avoids the complexity of managing dependencies during extraction. However, it can leave latent code and requires additional effort to improve the code quality.

#### Trade-offs and Decision Making

Addison and Austen, characters in a case study, evaluated both approaches for their Sysops Squad application. They decided on component-based decomposition due to its structured nature and the existing well-defined component boundaries, which reduced the risk of duplicate code and improved maintainability. This approach, though slower, allows for collaborative work and better domain boundary identification.

#### Component-Based Decomposition Patterns

Several patterns aid in component-based decomposition:

- **Identify and Size Components**: First step in managing component size and definition.
- **Gather Common Domain Components**: Consolidates common logic to minimize duplication.
- **Flatten Components**: Ensures components are well-defined and organized.
- **Determine Component Dependencies**: Identifies and refines dependencies for migration feasibility.
- **Create Component Domains**: Groups components into logical domains.
- **Create Domain Services**: Physically separates domains into distinct services.

These patterns are applied sequentially during migration and individually for ongoing maintenance. They are documented through architecture stories, which describe structural refactoring driven by business needs.

Overall, the choice between component-based decomposition and tactical forking depends on the codebase's structure and the desired balance between speed and maintainability. Each approach has its benefits and challenges, requiring architects to carefully assess their specific context and goals.



### Summary

In software development, managing technical debt and architectural changes is crucial. Technical debt stories address code cleanup, while architecture stories focus on immediate changes to support business needs. A key pattern in monolithic migration is the **Identify and Size Components Pattern**, which involves cataloging and sizing architectural components to ensure modularity.

#### Component Identification and Sizing

Components are the building blocks of services, and their identification and sizing are critical. Oversized components are often tightly coupled and difficult to separate into services, compromising modularity. Conversely, undersized components may not perform enough functions. A useful metric for sizing is the total number of statements within a component, which helps gauge complexity and functionality.

Components should generally fall within one to two standard deviations of the average size, with the percentage of code evenly distributed. Static code analysis tools can help, but architects often need to manually calculate total statements and their distribution.

#### Key Metrics

- **Component Name**: A descriptive identifier used consistently across documentation.
- **Component Namespace**: The logical or physical grouping of source code files.
- **Percent**: The component's relative size as a percentage of the overall codebase.
- **Statements**: The total number of source code statements in a component, indicating size and complexity.
- **Files**: The number of source files, which provides insight into class structure.

#### Resizing Components

Large components can be decomposed using functional or domain-driven approaches. For example, a "Trouble Ticket" component responsible for creation, assignment, routing, and completion can be split into smaller components.

#### Fitness Functions for Governance

Automated fitness functions help maintain component size and structure during application maintenance. Examples include:

1. **Maintain Component Inventory**: Alerts architects to new or removed components.
2. **Component Size Threshold**: Identifies components exceeding a specified percentage of the codebase.
3. **Standard Deviation Threshold**: Flags components exceeding a set number of standard deviations from the mean size.

#### Case Study: Sysops Squad Application

In the Sysops Squad application, the "Reporting" component was disproportionately large, containing 33% of the codebase. It was broken into smaller components: "Ticket Reports," "Expert Reports," "Financial Reports," and "Reporting Shared," distributing the code more evenly.

#### Gather Common Domain Components Pattern

This pattern consolidates shared domain functionality into a single component, distinguishing it from infrastructure functionality. It reduces duplication and facilitates the creation of common services. Identifying common domain logic often requires manual analysis, supported by automated tools.

Overall, these patterns and practices ensure a modular, maintainable architecture, facilitating the transition from monolithic to distributed systems.



In large codebases, common domain functionalities often spread across multiple components, creating opportunities for consolidation. For instance, if a class like `SMTPConnection` is used by various classes in different namespaces, it indicates that email notification functionality could be centralized. Similarly, components like Ticket Auditing, Billing Auditing, and Survey Auditing, which all write actions to an audit table, can be consolidated into a shared component to reduce code duplication.

Consolidation can occur via shared services or libraries, each having its pros and cons, detailed in Chapter 8. Automating governance of shared domain functionality is challenging due to its subjective nature. However, fitness functions can help identify common functionalities. One such function detects common names in namespace leaf nodes, alerting architects to analyze potential shared logic. Another function identifies common code across components, helping to pinpoint duplicate domain logic.

The Sysops Squad Saga illustrates the application of the Gather Common Domain Components pattern. Addison, an architect, identifies three notification components that share functionality: Customer Notification, Ticket Notify, and Survey Notify. By consolidating these into a single component, the overall coupling remains unchanged, simplifying the architecture without increasing dependencies.

Addison's analysis shows that while consolidating components can increase incoming coupling, it doesn't necessarily affect the overall coupling if managed carefully. The consolidation leads to reduced duplication and streamlined functionality. The process involves refactoring the code into a unified namespace, as demonstrated by the Sysops Squad's transition to a single Notification component.

The Flatten Components pattern addresses the issue of components losing identity when built on top of others. It ensures components are represented as leaf nodes in a directory structure, avoiding orphaned classes. For instance, in the Sysops Squad application, the Survey component's orphaned classes are moved to create well-defined components, either by merging namespaces or decomposing functionality into new components.

Shared code within root namespaces should be moved to separate components, like `ss.survey.shared`, to avoid orphaned classes. This practice aids in governance, allowing architects to assess the feasibility of transitioning to a distributed architecture by analyzing shared code metrics.

Overall, these patterns emphasize the importance of organizing code into well-defined components, reducing duplication, and maintaining manageable dependencies. Fitness functions play a crucial role in automating the detection of potential consolidation opportunities, supporting architects in optimizing the codebase structure.



### Summary

The process of flattening components during a monolithic migration involves restructuring code to ensure that components remain organized and manageable. A key strategy is to identify orphaned classes and move them into appropriate namespaces. The pseudocode provided outlines a method to alert architects when code appears in root namespaces, helping maintain a flat structure.

In the Sysops Squad case study, Addison applied the "Gather Common Domain Components Pattern" and discovered orphaned classes in the Survey and Ticket components. To address this, Addison considered two options: consolidating code into the `ss.ticket` component or breaking it into separate components. Due to the complexity of the ticket assignment functionality, Addison opted to create new components for orphaned classes, resulting in a more organized structure with distinct responsibilities.

For the Survey component, Addison found it less complex and rarely changing. After consulting with Sydney and Skyler, Addison merged the `ss.survey.templates` into the `ss.survey` namespace, simplifying the structure.

The "Flatten Components Pattern" effectively eliminated orphaned classes and ensured components were contained in leaf nodes. This restructuring was documented in Table 5-12, showing a refined component organization.

The "Determine Component Dependencies Pattern" is crucial for assessing the feasibility of migrating a monolithic application to a distributed architecture. This pattern involves analyzing dependencies between components to create a service dependency graph. Understanding these dependencies helps determine the level of effort required for migration—ranging from straightforward (golf ball) to complex (airliner).

Tools and visualizations, like dependency diagrams, assist in this analysis. For instance, a monolithic application with minimal dependencies is easier to break apart compared to one with high coupling. The pattern helps identify opportunities to refactor dependencies before migration, ensuring a smoother transition.

Fitness functions can automate governance by setting limits on component dependencies. For example, a fitness function might alert if a component exceeds a certain number of dependencies or restrict certain components from coupling with others. These functions are integrated into CI/CD pipelines to maintain manageable coupling levels.

In the Sysops Squad scenario, Addison used an IDE plug-in to visualize component dependencies, initially revealing extensive coupling. However, after filtering out shared libraries, the dependencies appeared more manageable, indicating the application was suitable for transitioning to a distributed architecture.

The "Create Component Domains Pattern" further aids in organizing components into domains, facilitating the creation of domain services. This approach aligns with a service-based architecture, serving as a stepping-stone to more distributed architectures.

Overall, these patterns and strategies provide a structured approach to managing and migrating monolithic applications, ensuring clarity and efficiency in the process.



### Summary

In a service-based architecture, component domains are represented through hierarchical namespaces. This structure helps identify domains and subdomains of functionality, essential for refactoring older monolithic applications to align with domain-driven design principles. For example, components within a Customer domain may initially have unrelated namespaces, which can be refactored to reflect their association with the domain, enhancing clarity and organization.

**Governance and Fitness Functions**: Once refactored, it's crucial to govern these component domains to ensure adherence to namespace rules. Automated fitness functions can be implemented to restrict namespaces to approved domains, preventing inadvertent creation of new domains. For instance, using tools like ArchUnit, developers can ensure that only specified domains exist within an application.

**Domain Identification and Refactoring**: Addison and Austen, working with the Sysops Squad application, identified five main domains: Ticketing, Reporting, Customer, Admin, and Shared. They ensured components were grouped correctly, aligning namespaces with their respective domains. This process involved creating architecture stories for refactoring components to fit within the identified domains.

**Service-Based Architecture**: After components are properly grouped into domains, they can be transitioned into separately deployed domain services, forming a service-based architecture. This architecture allows for a single user interface to access coarse-grained domain services, sharing a monolithic database initially. Over time, this setup provides insights into whether further decomposition into microservices is necessary.

**Breaking Apart Monolithic Databases**: Transitioning to a service-based architecture often necessitates breaking apart monolithic databases. This process is complex due to the high coupling of data to application functionality. The decision to decompose data should consider factors like change control, connection management, scalability, fault tolerance, architectural quanta, and database type optimization.

**Data Decomposition Drivers**: Key drivers for data decomposition include the ability to manage changes, handle connections, scale effectively, ensure fault tolerance, and optimize database types. Balancing these drivers with the need to keep data integrated is crucial for successful decomposition.

**Conclusion**: Applying component-based decomposition patterns offers a structured approach to breaking apart monolithic architectures. This sets the stage for further decomposition into microservices, as needed, and aligns with the broader goal of transitioning to a more distributed and scalable architecture.



In distributed systems, managing database changes is crucial due to the risk of breaking changes, which can disrupt multiple services. This is particularly challenging with relational databases, where schema changes like dropping tables or altering column types can necessitate coordinated updates across many services. The complexity increases with the number of services involved, as forgotten services may fail until updated. The concept of bounded contexts, from Domain-Driven Design, helps mitigate these issues by encapsulating data and services within specific boundaries. This approach isolates changes, ensuring only affected services within the same context need updates.

Bounded contexts also facilitate data abstraction, allowing services to interact through contracts (e.g., JSON or XML) rather than direct database access. This abstraction decouples services from the underlying database schema, preventing changes in the database from impacting unrelated services. For instance, if a database column is altered, only the service owning that data needs modification, preserving the contract with other services.

Connection management is another critical aspect. Establishing database connections is resource-intensive, and distributed architectures can quickly saturate available connections. Each service typically has its own connection pool, which can lead to excessive connections when services scale. To address this, a connection quota system can be implemented, allocating a maximum number of connections per service. This can be adjusted dynamically based on usage patterns to optimize resource distribution.

Scalability is a significant driver for database decomposition. As services scale, the database must also handle increased load and connections. Breaking apart databases into smaller, service-specific databases can improve scalability by reducing the load on each database and enhancing performance. This approach also increases fault tolerance by eliminating the database as a single point of failure. If one database fails, only the services dependent on it are affected, allowing others to continue functioning.

Architectural quantum, a concept involving independent deployment units with high cohesion and coupling, guides database decomposition. Services requiring different architectural characteristics should not share a database, as this ties them into a single quantum, limiting flexibility. By breaking up the database, services can form distinct quanta, enabling independent evolution and deployment.

In summary, managing data decomposition in distributed systems involves addressing change control, connection management, scalability, fault tolerance, and architectural considerations. Bounded contexts and data abstraction are key strategies for isolating changes and maintaining service independence. Connection quotas and database partitioning enhance scalability and fault tolerance, while architectural quantum considerations ensure optimal deployment and evolution.



The text discusses strategies for decomposing monolithic databases into more efficient, domain-specific structures, particularly in the context of microservices. It highlights the challenges and benefits of breaking apart and integrating data based on its nature and usage patterns.

### Key Concepts

1. **Data Disintegration vs. Integration**:
   - **Data Disintegration** involves breaking apart monolithic databases to optimize data handling by moving specific data types to more suitable database systems. For instance, key-value data is better managed in a key-value database rather than a relational one.
   - **Data Integration** focuses on when to consolidate data, considering factors like data relationships (foreign keys, triggers) and transactional integrity (ACID transactions).

2. **Integration Drivers**:
   - **Data Relationships**: Tightly coupled data, such as those with foreign keys and views, pose challenges in decomposition. These are crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency.
   - **Database Transactions**: Single transactional units of work are easier to manage within the same schema or database. Breaking apart data can complicate transactions, leading to potential consistency issues.

3. **Decomposition Justifications**:
   - **Performance Issues**: Splitting databases can resolve performance bottlenecks, such as those caused by concurrent reporting and operational queries.
   - **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Decomposing databases can improve scalability and fault tolerance by distributing the load and isolating failures within specific domains.

4. **Five-Step Process for Decomposition**:
   - **Analyze and Create Data Domains**: Identify domain groupings within the database to understand tight coupling and dependencies.
   - **Assign Tables to Data Domains**: Group tables into schemas based on their domain, ensuring that related tables are kept together to maintain functionality.
   - **Remove Cross-Domain Dependencies**: Eliminate foreign keys, views, and other dependencies that cross domain boundaries to ensure that each service accesses only its relevant data.
   - **Use Synonyms Sparingly**: While synonyms can provide alternate names for cross-domain tables, they should be used cautiously to avoid introducing new coupling points.

5. **Practical Example**:
   - The Sysops Squad case study illustrates the decomposition process. The team justifies breaking apart their monolithic database to improve system performance and scalability, despite the complexity of removing numerous foreign keys and views.

6. **Data Domain and Schema Relationship**:
   - A data domain is an architectural concept representing a set of related database artifacts. A schema is a database construct that holds these objects. While typically one-to-one, multiple schemas can map to a single data domain when necessary.

### Conclusion

Decomposing a monolithic database requires careful analysis of data relationships and transactional needs. By applying a structured process, organizations can achieve better performance, scalability, and fault tolerance while maintaining data integrity and consistency.



This document outlines a multi-step process for transitioning from monolithic to distributed database architectures, focusing on separating data domains and optimizing database usage.

### Step 1: Move Integration Points
Integration points are shifted from the database to the application layer, facilitating easier dependency checking and code analysis. While this doesn't eliminate cross-schema queries, it aids in future separation.

### Step 2: Assign Tables to Data Domains
Tables are assigned to specific data domains, which involves removing cross-schema access. Each service connects to its schema, ensuring data sovereignty. Benefits include schema changes without affecting other domains and using the most suitable database technology per service. However, challenges include performance issues and potential data quality concerns.

### Step 3: Separate Database Connections
Database connection logic is refactored so each service accesses only its data domain. This step eliminates cross-schema access and ensures data sovereignty, allowing each service to own its data. While beneficial, it poses challenges like performance issues with large data volumes and the inability to maintain referential integrity.

### Step 4: Move Schemas to Separate Database Servers
Data domains are moved to separate physical databases to avoid a single architecture quantum, which can affect scalability, fault tolerance, and performance. Two options are available: backup and restore, which requires downtime, and replication, which avoids downtime but requires more setup.

### Step 5: Switch to Independent Database Servers
Once schemas are replicated, services switch to independent database servers, allowing optimization for availability and scalability. This setup supports polyglot database usage, where different database types are used within the ecosystem.

### Selecting a Database Type
The document discusses the revolution in database technologies since 2005, highlighting the paradox of choice due to numerous products. It presents star ratings for database types based on characteristics like ease of learning, data modeling, scalability, availability, consistency, and community support.

#### Relational Databases
Known for SQL and ACID properties, relational databases are easy to learn and model but can be complex to scale. They support balanced read/write priorities and have extensive community support.

#### Key-Value Databases
These databases function like a hash table, supporting operations like get, put, and delete. They are easy to learn and scale but require careful aggregate design. They offer tunable consistency and are often used for session storage.

#### Document Databases
Document databases use JSON or XML, allowing for flexible data modeling and indexing. They are easy to learn and scale but require careful sharding and consistency management. They are popular among NoSQL databases due to their flexibility and community support.

### Conclusion
The document emphasizes the importance of selecting the right database type based on specific needs, considering factors like ease of learning, scalability, and consistency. It also highlights the need for careful planning and execution when transitioning to a distributed architecture.



### Summary of Database Types and Characteristics

#### Schema-less Databases
NoSQL databases often feature data and schema duplication, allowing flexibility as no two entries need to be identical in schema or attribute names. Despite being termed "schema-less," these databases still have implicit schemas. Applications must handle various schema versions, and the claim of being entirely schema-less is misleading.

#### Column Family Databases
Column family databases, like Apache Cassandra, organize data in rows with varying columns, each as a name-value pair. They are highly scalable, supporting high read/write throughput and operating in clusters for improved availability and partition tolerance. These databases use tunable consistency, allowing trade-offs between consistency and availability.

#### Graph Databases
Graph databases store entities as nodes with properties and use edges to represent relationships. They have a steep learning curve, especially in modeling domains into nodes and relations. While read scaling is improved through replication, write throughput is limited by the database type. Graph databases support ACID transactions, and languages like Cypher facilitate querying.

#### NewSQL Databases
NewSQL databases combine the scalability of NoSQL with relational features like ACID transactions. They support SQL and allow horizontal scaling, improving availability and partition tolerance. The learning curve is easier due to familiarity with SQL, but sharding design adds complexity.

#### Cloud Native Databases
Cloud databases like Snowflake and Amazon Redshift offer reduced operational burdens with cost transparency. They vary in learning curves and data modeling approaches, with some requiring unique practices. These databases are easily scalable in the cloud, offering high availability and ACID transactions.

#### Time-Series Databases
Optimized for time-series analytics, these databases store sequences of data points over time. They are append-only and suited for read-heavy workloads. Time-series databases like InfluxDB provide scalability and availability configurations, with some supporting ACID consistency.

### Database Selection Considerations

- **Ease of Use**: Varies across database types, with graph and column family databases having steeper learning curves.
- **Data Modeling**: Familiarity with relational databases aids in NewSQL and some cloud databases, while time-series databases require understanding of append-only operations.
- **Scalability and Throughput**: Column family and NewSQL databases excel in scalability, while graph databases are limited in write throughput.
- **Availability and Partition Tolerance**: Cloud native and NewSQL databases offer high availability and partition tolerance.
- **Consistency**: NewSQL and some graph databases provide strong consistency, while others offer tunable consistency levels.

### Sysops Squad Saga: Polyglot Databases

In a case study, the Sysops Squad team debated migrating survey data from a relational to a document database. Dana, the data architect, opposed the change, citing potential disruptions. However, Skyler and Devon argued for a document database to ease user interface development. They agreed to collaborate on a justification to integrate the new database type, emphasizing the need for teamwork between development and database teams.



The Sysops Squad team faced challenges with the customer survey system, which was causing frustration due to its inflexibility and slow response to change requests. Addison, a team member, proposed migrating the survey data from a relational database to a document database to improve flexibility and responsiveness. Parker, the product owner, confirmed that the marketing department needed better flexibility and quicker IT responses, providing business justification for the migration.

The existing relational database structure included a Survey table and a Question table, with a one-to-many relationship. The team considered two document database models: a single aggregate model, where survey and question data are stored in one document, and a multiple aggregate model, where questions are stored independently. Skyler preferred the single aggregate model for its ease of rendering in the user interface, while Devon favored the multiple aggregate model to avoid data duplication. Addison noted that there were only five survey types and most changes involved questions, leading the team to choose the single aggregate model for its simplicity and ease of use.

Addison documented the decision in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR), highlighting the need for flexibility and the benefits of the document database in simplifying the user interface. However, the team acknowledged that updating common survey questions would require changes to multiple documents, and survey functionality would need to be paused during data migration.

As the migration commenced, Addison and Austen grappled with service granularity decisions, debating whether to split or combine services like ticketing and customer functionality. Taylen, the tech lead, advocated for fine-grained microservices, while Logan emphasized balancing granularity disintegrators and integrators to determine appropriate service size. Granularity disintegrators guide when to break services into smaller parts based on factors like service scope, code volatility, scalability, and security. Granularity integrators suggest when to combine services, achieving equilibrium between these forces.

The confusion between modularity and granularity often complicates these decisions. Modularity involves breaking systems into parts, while granularity concerns the size of those parts. Metrics like the number of statements or public interfaces can help assess service granularity objectively. Ultimately, achieving the right granularity requires balancing these metrics with the practical needs of the system.

The team recognized that not all parts of an application need microservices, and the single-responsibility principle can be subjective. They used examples like a Notification Service to illustrate cohesion and scope, showing how strong cohesion might argue against splitting services despite the temptation to create single-purpose microservices. The decision-making process involved careful consideration of service scope, function, and the trade-offs between cohesion and granularity.

In summary, the team's migration to a document database aimed to address flexibility and responsiveness issues, while service granularity decisions required balancing technical principles with practical needs, using metrics and principles to guide their architecture choices.



In software architecture, determining the appropriate granularity of services is crucial for optimizing functionality and performance. Developers often face challenges in deciding the size and scope of services due to the subjective nature of defining a single responsibility. Key drivers for breaking down services include code volatility, scalability, fault tolerance, security, and extensibility.

**Code Volatility**: This refers to the rate at which a service's code changes. For example, if a notification service has components that change at different rates (e.g., postal letter functionality changes weekly, while SMS and email change every six months), it may be beneficial to separate these into distinct services. This reduces testing scope and deployment risk.

**Scalability and Throughput**: Services with varying scalability demands should be separated to optimize resource use. For instance, in a notification service, SMS notifications might require scaling to 220,000 messages per minute, while email and postal notifications have much lower demands. Separating these allows each to scale independently, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

**Fault Tolerance**: Separating services can enhance fault tolerance by isolating failures. In a combined notification service, a failure in the email component could bring down the entire service. By splitting into SMS, Email, and Postal Letter services, each can fail independently without affecting others.

**Security**: Security concerns can also drive service separation. For example, a customer profile service that handles both profile and credit card information might risk exposing sensitive data. By separating these functions into distinct services, access can be more tightly controlled.

**Extensibility**: Services that are likely to expand should be designed with extensibility in mind. A payment service managing multiple payment methods can be split into separate services for each method, facilitating easier addition of new methods without impacting existing functionality.

Conversely, **Granularity Integrators** suggest when services might be better consolidated. Key integrators include:

- **Database Transactions**: If a single-unit-of-work ACID transaction is necessary, services should remain consolidated. For instance, customer registration involving profile and password information might require a single transaction to maintain data integrity.

- **Workflow and Choreography**: Excessive interservice communication can degrade performance and fault tolerance. If services are too interdependent, it might be better to keep them together to avoid latency and reliability issues.

- **Performance and Responsiveness**: High communication overhead between services can impact performance. If multiple services need to communicate frequently, consolidating them can improve response times.

- **Reliability and Data Integrity**: When operations require coordination across multiple services, the risk of data inconsistency increases. Keeping related functionalities together can mitigate this risk.

In summary, the decision to break down or consolidate services should balance the benefits of granularity with the potential drawbacks of increased complexity and communication overhead. Each driver and integrator provides a framework for evaluating service architecture to achieve optimal performance and maintainability.



In distributed architectures, managing data integrity and consistency is crucial, particularly when services are broken apart. This often necessitates compensating transactions or marking data states to resume transactions, a complex issue detailed in "Transactional Saga Patterns."

Shared code, such as logging or security utilities, is common in software development but can complicate service granularity in distributed systems. Shared libraries, like JARs or DLLs, bind services at compile time. Changes in shared libraries require updates across all dependent services, potentially necessitating service consolidation to avoid deployment issues. However, infrastructure-related functionalities like logging do not typically drive granularity integration.

Key considerations for shared code as a granularity integrator include:

1. **Shared Domain Functionality**: If shared domain logic is significant, consolidating services may be advisable.
2. **Frequent Changes**: Regular updates to shared code necessitate coordinated service changes, suggesting consolidation.
3. **Defects**: Some business functionalities require simultaneous updates across services, making consolidation beneficial.

Data relationships also influence service granularity. When services are broken apart, data must be organized into bounded contexts to maintain availability and reliability. If services frequently access each other's data, consolidation might be necessary to reduce communication overhead and improve performance.

Finding the right balance in service granularity involves understanding when to break apart or consolidate services. Trade-offs must be analyzed collaboratively with business stakeholders. Disintegrator drivers include service scope, code volatility, scalability, fault tolerance, security access, and extensibility. Integrator drivers focus on database transactions, workflow, shared code, and data relationships.

Examples illustrate these trade-offs:

- **Example 1**: Balancing agility and data integrity.
- **Example 2**: Weighing data consistency against security.
- **Example 3**: Considering extensibility versus responsiveness.

A case study on Sysops Squad's ticket assignment highlights the decision-making process. The team debated whether to separate assignment and routing functions. Ultimately, they decided on a single service due to tight functional coupling, opting for distinct architectural components to manage code changes.

Another example involves customer registration, where debate arose over consolidating customer information into a single service versus separating it into distinct services for profile, credit card, password, and supported products. The decision involved considerations of PCI and PII data management.

In summary, achieving optimal service granularity requires a careful analysis of both technical and business needs, considering the trade-offs between disintegration and integration drivers. This ensures that services are structured to support maintainability, performance, and business objectives effectively.



In the context of customer registration for Sysops Squad, the development team faced a challenge regarding service granularity, particularly concerning the handling of sensitive data like credit card and password information. Austen, a team member, facilitated a discussion with Parker, the product owner, and Sam, a security expert, to address these concerns. The main issue was whether to use separate services for profile, credit card, password, and product information or a single consolidated service. The team needed to ensure that all customer data was saved as a single atomic transaction to meet the "all-or-nothing" requirement, which was crucial for data integrity.

Sam emphasized the importance of securing sensitive information, suggesting that separate services could enhance security access control. However, this would complicate the transaction process. Austen proposed using the Tortoise security libraries to secure API calls and service mesh access, providing a double-check on security. This approach allowed the team to maintain a single service while ensuring robust security measures.

The decision was made to create a single consolidated customer service to support ACID transactions, using Tortoise security libraries to mitigate security risks. This choice balanced the need for transactionality and security, acknowledging that while separate services could offer better security access, they would not support the necessary atomic transactions.

In the broader context of distributed architectures, the text discusses the complexities of code reuse, particularly in microservices environments. Shared libraries and services present trade-offs in terms of dependency management and change control. A coarse-grained shared library simplifies dependencies but complicates change control, as any change affects all services using the library. Conversely, fine-grained libraries improve change control but increase dependency complexity.

The text advises against large, coarse-grained shared libraries, recommending smaller, functionally partitioned libraries to favor change control over dependency management. Versioning shared libraries is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility and agility, allowing services to adopt changes as needed without disrupting other services.

Overall, the text highlights the importance of balancing service granularity, security, and transactionality in system design, alongside effective management of code reuse and versioning in distributed architectures.



### Summary

Versioning in distributed architectures, particularly with shared libraries, is complex and often misunderstood. It allows individual services to update without impacting others, enhancing agility. However, communicating version changes in a distributed system can be challenging. Tools like JFrog Artifactory help manage versions, but coordination is still necessary. Deprecation strategies for older versions vary; custom strategies cater to individual libraries' change rates, while global strategies are simpler but less effective. A global strategy can lead to frequent retesting and redeployment, affecting productivity. Serious defects or breaking changes can invalidate deprecation strategies, necessitating immediate updates across services.

Avoid using the "LATEST" version in production, as it can lead to compatibility issues during quick fixes. While versioning offers agility, dependency management can be complex. Shared libraries are ideal for environments with low to moderate code change and maintain operational characteristics like performance and scalability.

The shared service technique offers an alternative, deploying shared functionality separately. This method supports runtime changes without redeploying dependent services but introduces risks like runtime failures. Versioning in shared services often involves API endpoint versioning, which can be subjective and complex, especially with multiple protocols like messaging and gRPC.

Performance is impacted by network latency when using shared services. Techniques like gRPC and asynchronous messaging can mitigate some latency issues. Shared services must also scale with dependent services, complicating management. Fault tolerance is a concern, as service unavailability affects all dependent services.

Shared services are suitable for polyglot environments with frequent code changes but come with trade-offs in performance, scalability, and runtime risks. They preserve bounded context and avoid code duplication but require careful management of versioning and dependencies.

The Sidecar pattern addresses operational coupling by decoupling domain logic from technical concerns. This pattern uses a separate component, or sidecar, for operational capabilities like monitoring and logging. It allows for consistency across services and can form a service mesh for unified control. This approach balances the benefits of microservices' integration focus with the need for consistent operational management.

In summary, both shared libraries and shared services have their advantages and trade-offs. Shared libraries offer compile-time safety and are best for stable environments, while shared services provide runtime flexibility but require careful handling of performance and versioning issues. The Sidecar pattern offers a way to manage operational concerns consistently across diverse platforms.



### Summary

In software architecture, the **Sidecar pattern** and **service mesh** are techniques used to manage cross-cutting operational concerns, such as logging, monitoring, and service discovery, independently from domain-specific behavior. This pattern is akin to the Decorator Design Pattern, allowing architects to "decorate" behavior across a distributed architecture without affecting the core connectivity.

#### Orthogonal Coupling
Orthogonal coupling refers to the intersection of two independent architectural concerns, such as operational tasks versus domain-specific tasks. Recognizing these intersections helps minimize entanglement between concerns.

#### Trade-Offs of the Sidecar Pattern
- **Advantages**: Provides a consistent way to manage isolated coupling and infrastructure coordination.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires implementation per platform, can become large and complex, and ownership can be centralized or distributed among teams.

#### Implementation and Ownership
A shared infrastructure team typically manages the sidecar component, ensuring consistency across services. However, domain-specific components should not be included in the sidecar to avoid inappropriate coupling.

#### Code Reuse and Its Challenges
While reuse is often seen as beneficial, it can lead to architectural brittleness if not properly managed. Reuse should be evaluated based on the rate of change. Slow-changing components like operating systems and open-source libraries are suitable for reuse, whereas rapidly changing internal components are not.

#### Platform Reuse
Platforms are emerging as the new focus for reuse, with well-defined APIs that allow for internal changes without affecting external interfaces. This approach reduces brittleness and supports integration.

#### Case Study: Sysops Squad
The Sysops Squad team faced challenges with shared library usage, particularly with logging duplication. The solution involved implementing a service mesh with shared operational behavior managed by a sidecar component. This allowed logging, monitoring, and other operational tasks to be centralized, reducing the burden on individual teams.

#### Decision-Making Process
The team debated between using a shared data service versus a shared library for database logic. The decision favored a shared library due to performance, scalability, and fault tolerance concerns. The shared library approach minimized service coupling and avoided additional service dependencies and HTTP traffic.

#### Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
- **Sidecar for Operational Coupling**: Consolidates shared operational tasks, managed by a shared infrastructure team.
- **Shared Library for Database Logic**: Improves performance and reduces service dependencies, though it requires careful management of changes and versioning.

Overall, the emphasis is on balancing reuse with architectural agility, ensuring that shared components do not introduce unwanted dependencies or complexity. The careful evaluation of trade-offs and the establishment of clear ownership and management responsibilities are crucial for maintaining a robust and flexible architecture.



In distributed systems, defining data ownership and managing distributed transactions are critical tasks. This involves forming bounded contexts between services and data, assigning table ownership to services. A key rule is that the service performing write operations to a table owns it. However, complexities arise with joint or common ownership, where multiple services write to the same table.

**Ownership Scenarios:**

1. **Single Ownership:** Only one service writes to a table, making ownership straightforward. For example, if a Wishlist Service is the only one writing to a Wishlist table, it clearly owns the table.

2. **Common Ownership:** Multiple services need to write to the same table, like an Audit table, complicating ownership. A common solution is to designate a single service as the sole owner, with other services sending data to it for updates. This can be done via asynchronous messaging if no return data is needed, or synchronous communication if confirmation is required.

3. **Joint Ownership:** Occurs when a few services within the same domain write to the same table. Techniques to resolve this include:

   - **Table Split Technique:** Divides a table into multiple tables, each owned by a different service, ensuring single ownership. This requires careful synchronization between services to maintain data consistency.

   - **Data Domain Technique:** Involves creating a shared data domain where services share data, forming a broader bounded context. This method allows services to remain independent but increases complexity in managing schema changes and governance.

   - **Delegate Technique:** Assigns one service as the table owner, with others delegating updates to it. Ownership can be determined by primary domain priority (the service performing most CRUD operations) or operational characteristics priority (the service needing higher performance or availability).

Each technique has trade-offs concerning data consistency, performance, scalability, and service independence. For instance, the table split technique offers clear ownership but complicates synchronization, while the data domain technique simplifies performance issues but requires coordinated schema changes.

In summary, assigning data ownership in distributed architectures requires careful consideration of service interactions, data consistency, and operational requirements. Collaboration between teams is essential to address these challenges effectively.



In a distributed system, data ownership and updates can lead to complex interservice communication challenges. The delegate technique assigns table ownership to a single service, necessitating communication between services for updates. This can be synchronous, ensuring data consistency but impacting performance, or asynchronous, improving speed but leading to eventual consistency and potential data integrity issues. The delegate approach often results in service coupling, lack of atomic transactions, and low fault tolerance.

Alternatively, the service consolidation technique combines multiple table owners into a single service, addressing joint ownership issues and improving atomic transactions. However, this increases testing scope, deployment risk, and impacts scalability and fault tolerance, as all parts of the service must scale equally.

ACID transactions, characterized by atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, ensure all updates are committed or rolled back as a unit. In contrast, distributed transactions, which span multiple services, cannot support ACID properties. Instead, they rely on BASE properties: basic availability, soft state, and eventual consistency. Each service commits its data independently, leading to potential inconsistencies and lack of isolation.

Eventual consistency in distributed systems is achieved through patterns like background synchronization, orchestrated request-based, and event-based patterns. These patterns help synchronize data across services over time, balancing operational characteristics like performance and fault tolerance with data consistency needs. For instance, background synchronization periodically checks and aligns data, suitable for scenarios where immediate consistency isn't critical.

In summary, managing data ownership and transactions in distributed systems involves trade-offs between consistency, performance, and fault tolerance. Techniques like delegation and service consolidation offer different benefits and drawbacks, while understanding ACID and BASE properties is crucial for effective architecture design. Eventual consistency patterns provide mechanisms to handle data synchronization, ensuring system efficiency and reliability.



The text discusses various patterns for managing data consistency in distributed systems, focusing on the background synchronization, orchestrated request-based, and event-based patterns.

### Background Synchronization Pattern

This pattern involves a background process to ensure data consistency after responding to user requests. For example, when a customer unsubscribes from a service, they receive immediate confirmation, but data synchronization occurs later. While this improves responsiveness, it causes tight coupling between data sources and services, breaking bounded contexts. Shared data ownership complicates structural changes and can lead to duplicated business logic. This pattern is suitable for closed systems that don't share data frequently.

### Orchestrated Request-Based Pattern

In this pattern, an orchestrator manages the distributed transaction, ensuring all data sources are synchronized during the business request. This can be handled by an existing service or a dedicated orchestration service. While it ensures atomic business requests and data consistency, it introduces slower responsiveness, complex error handling, and potential tight coupling between services. Error handling is particularly challenging, as compensating transactions may be needed if inconsistencies arise.

### Event-Based Pattern

The event-based pattern uses asynchronous publish-and-subscribe messaging to achieve eventual consistency. Services listen for events and respond accordingly, allowing for quick data consistency and service decoupling. However, error handling can be complex, especially if a service fails while processing an event. Messages are typically sent to a dead letter queue if repeated delivery attempts fail, requiring automated or manual intervention.

### Trade-Offs Summary

**Background Synchronization:**
- **Advantages:** Decoupled services, good responsiveness.
- **Disadvantages:** Data source coupling, complex implementation, duplicated business logic.

**Orchestrated Request-Based:**
- **Advantages:** Decoupled services, atomic requests.
- **Disadvantages:** Slower responsiveness, complex error handling, need for compensating transactions.

**Event-Based:**
- **Advantages:** Decoupled services, fast responsiveness.
- **Disadvantages:** Complex error handling.

### Sysops Squad Saga

The narrative illustrates the challenges of data ownership and distributed transaction management. Sydney and Addison learn the importance of collaboration between service and data teams to form bounded contexts. They decide that the service performing write actions on a table should own it. In cases of joint-table ownership, options include using a common data domain or designating a single service as the owner. These decisions help streamline their approach to managing data consistency in their system.




In a distributed system, managing data ownership and access is complex. Sydney and Addison face challenges with the Ticket Completion Service and Survey Service, where both need to write to the Survey table. A common schema isn't feasible due to existing connections. Instead, they decide the Survey Service will own the Survey table. The Ticket Completion Service will pass necessary data to the Survey Service via a message, eliminating direct access needs.

For distributed data access, several patterns are explored:

1. **Interservice Communication Pattern**: This common method involves a service requesting data from another service using remote protocols. While simple, it suffers from latency issues (network, security, and data), service coupling, and scalability constraints. Each request involves a synchronous call, impacting performance and availability.

2. **Column Schema Replication Pattern**: Data columns are replicated across tables, allowing services to access data without remote calls. This improves performance and fault tolerance but introduces data consistency and ownership challenges. Asynchronous communication helps with data synchronization, but governance is necessary to maintain data integrity.

3. **Replicated Caching Pattern**: This pattern uses in-memory caches synchronized across services, offering high responsiveness and fault tolerance. Each service has its own cache, reducing interservice communication. However, it requires careful management of service dependencies and startup timing, as the owning service must populate the cache initially.

These patterns illustrate the trade-offs involved in distributed architectures, balancing performance, scalability, and data consistency. The choice of pattern depends on specific requirements such as data volume, responsiveness, and fault tolerance needs.



The text discusses two primary data access patterns in distributed architectures: replicated caching and data domain sharing, along with their trade-offs.

### Replicated Caching
Replicated caching offers good data access performance and fault tolerance. However, it has several trade-offs:
- **Startup Dependency**: The initial service instance relies on the availability of another service (e.g., the Catalog Service for the Wishlist Service).
- **Data Volume**: High data volumes (e.g., over 500 MB) can make this pattern less feasible due to memory constraints. Each service instance requires its own cache, leading to increased memory usage.
- **Data Volatility**: It's not suitable for highly volatile data due to synchronization challenges.
- **Configuration Complexity**: Configuring services in cloud environments can be challenging due to dynamic IP addresses and TCP/IP broadcast issues.

### Data Domain Pattern
The data domain pattern involves sharing tables between services, which resolves joint ownership issues and improves data consistency and integrity. Key advantages include:
- **Decoupled Services**: Services are not dependent on each other for availability, enhancing responsiveness and scalability.
- **High Data Consistency**: Data is accessed directly through SQL joins, preserving integrity and allowing for constraints like foreign keys.
- **No Service Dependency**: Once data is in the cache, service availability is not a concern.

However, this pattern has disadvantages:
- **Broader Bounded Context**: Changes in table structures may impact multiple services.
- **Security Concerns**: Shared access might expose sensitive data to unauthorized services.

### Sysops Squad Saga: Decision on Data Access
The Sysops Squad faces a decision on data access for the Ticket Assignment Service. They consider interservice communication and replicated caching. Given the relatively static nature and small size of the data (1.3 KB per expert for 900 experts), they opt for replicated caching. Key considerations include:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Once the cache is populated, the Ticket Assignment Service is operational even if the User Management Service goes down.
- **Startup Dependency**: At least one instance of the User Management Service must be running initially.
- **Technical and Licensing Considerations**: The team needs to research caching products and their compatibility with the deployment environment.

### Managing Distributed Workflows
The text also explores orchestration and choreography as coordination patterns in distributed systems:
- **Orchestration**: Involves an orchestrator to manage workflows, handling state, errors, and notifications. It is suitable for complex workflows with multiple paths.
- **Choreography**: Lacks a central orchestrator, promoting decoupled interactions among services.

The choice between these patterns depends on the specific needs of the architecture, considering factors like communication, consistency, and coordination.

Overall, architects must carefully analyze trade-offs to choose the appropriate data access and workflow management patterns for their distributed systems.



In managing distributed workflows, two primary communication styles are orchestration and choreography, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Orchestration involves a central orchestrator that coordinates the workflow, while choreography allows each service to interact independently, akin to dance partners.

**Orchestration Communication Style:**

- **Advantages:**
  - **Centralized Workflow:** Offers a unified component for state and behavior, beneficial as complexity increases.
  - **Error Handling:** Facilitated by having a state owner for the workflow.
  - **Recoverability:** An orchestrator can add logic to retry operations if services experience short-term outages.
  - **State Management:** Provides a queryable state of the workflow, aiding other workflows and transient states.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Responsiveness:** All communication goes through the mediator, potentially creating a bottleneck.
  - **Fault Tolerance:** Creates a single point of failure, though redundancy can mitigate this at the cost of added complexity.
  - **Scalability:** Less scalable due to more coordination points, reducing potential parallelism.
  - **Service Coupling:** Higher coupling between the orchestrator and domain components.

**Choreography Communication Style:**

- **Advantages:**
  - **Responsiveness:** Fewer single choke points, allowing for more parallelism.
  - **Scalability:** Lack of coordination points allows for more independent scaling.
  - **Fault Tolerance:** No single orchestrator enhances fault tolerance through multiple instances.
  - **Service Decoupling:** Less coupling as there is no orchestrator.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Distributed Workflow:** Error management and boundary conditions are more challenging without a workflow owner.
  - **State Management:** No centralized state holder complicates ongoing state management.
  - **Error Handling:** More difficult as domain services require more workflow knowledge.
  - **Recoverability:** Harder without an orchestrator for retries and remediation efforts.

**Trade-Offs:**

- **State Owner and Coupling:** Orchestration centralizes state ownership, reducing complexity in error scenarios but potentially creating bottlenecks. Choreography offers higher scalability and responsiveness but increases complexity in error handling.
- **Workflow Complexity:** Orchestration is more suitable for complex workflows with frequent errors, while choreography is ideal for simpler workflows requiring high responsiveness and scalability.

Ultimately, the choice between orchestration and choreography depends on the specific needs of the workflow, such as the complexity of error scenarios and the required level of scalability and responsiveness.

**Conclusion:**

Understanding the trade-offs between orchestration and choreography is crucial for architects managing distributed workflows. Orchestration provides structure and error handling, while choreography offers scalability and responsiveness. The decision should align with the workflow's complexity and operational requirements.



### Summary of Ticket Workflow and Transactional Sagas

#### Ticket Workflow Management

The text discusses two models for managing a ticket workflow: orchestration and choreography. The process involves several steps:

1. **Ticket Assignment**: A service assigns the ticket to the appropriate Sysops expert.
2. **Notification**: The customer is informed that the expert is en route.
3. **Problem Resolution**: The expert resolves the issue and marks the ticket as complete.
4. **Survey Request**: The customer is asked to fill out a survey.

The choice between orchestration and choreography involves trade-offs in workflow control, state query, and error handling. Orchestration provides easier control and error handling, making it the preferred choice for managing complex workflows. A table of trade-offs is used to evaluate these options.

#### Decision for Orchestration

The decision to use orchestration is based on its ability to handle lost or misrouted tickets, track ticket status, and manage error handling effectively. However, it may face scalability issues if requirements change.

#### Transactional Sagas

The concept of transactional sagas is explored, focusing on the challenges of distributed transactions. Sagas are sequences of local transactions with compensating updates to handle failures. The text outlines various saga patterns, each with different trade-offs:

1. **Epic Saga (sao)**: Uses synchronous communication, atomic consistency, and orchestrated coordination. It mimics monolithic systems but faces challenges in distributed environments due to high coupling and complexity.

2. **Phone Tag Saga (sac)**: Changes coordination to choreography while maintaining atomic consistency. It offers better scalability by reducing orchestration bottlenecks but increases complexity in domain services.

#### Characteristics of Saga Patterns

- **Epic Saga (sao)**: High coupling, low complexity, low responsiveness, and very low scalability due to orchestration and transactional requirements.
- **Phone Tag Saga (sac)**: Offers improved scalability and performance for non-error conditions but requires more complex service logic for error handling.

The text emphasizes that while the Epic Saga is familiar, it presents challenges in distributed systems, and alternative patterns may offer better trade-offs depending on specific needs. The discussion includes the importance of understanding these patterns to manage workflows and transactions effectively in distributed architectures.



### Summary of Transactional Saga Patterns

#### Parallel Saga (aeo)
- **Communication**: Asynchronous
- **Consistency**: Eventual
- **Coordination**: Orchestrated
- **Coupling**: Low
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Scale/Elasticity**: High

These patterns illustrate the trade-offs in designing distributed systems, balancing consistency, communication style, and coordination to meet specific architectural needs.



### Summary of Transactional Saga Patterns

**Microservices Architecture and Transactional Sagas:**

Microservices architecture allows for scalability and isolation between services by using smaller transaction boundaries. Public-facing services may require high scalability and elasticity, whereas back-office services prioritize security. This architecture supports high responsiveness due to asynchronous communication and independent transactional contexts, enabling variable service performance.

**Parallel Saga Pattern:**

The Parallel Saga pattern is characterized by asynchronous communication, eventual consistency, and orchestrated coordination. It offers low coupling and complexity, with high responsiveness and scalability, making it suitable for complex workflows requiring high scale.

**Anthology Saga Pattern:**

The Anthology Saga pattern uses asynchronous communication and choreographed coordination, resulting in the least coupling among saga patterns. It utilizes message queues for asynchronous messaging, maintaining transactional integrity without orchestration. This pattern supports high throughput and scalability but poses coordination challenges, especially in complex workflows. It is ideal for simple, linear workflows where performance and scale are key.

**State Management and Eventual Consistency:**

State management and eventual consistency involve using finite state machines to track the current state of a transactional saga, allowing for eventual error correction. For instance, the Fairy Tale Saga implementation demonstrates how errors are handled asynchronously, improving responsiveness from the end-user perspective.

**Saga State Machines:**

Saga state machines outline possible states and transitions within a distributed architecture. For example, a problem ticket in the Sysops Squad system transitions through states such as START, CREATED, ASSIGNED, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED, and CLOSED. Each state has defined outcomes and transitions, ensuring the workflow progresses smoothly.

**Techniques for Managing Sagas:**

Managing distributed transactions requires design and maintenance by developers. Techniques like using annotations in Java or custom attributes in C# help document and manage transactional sagas. These annotations identify services involved in sagas, aiding in testing and impact analysis. Custom tools can extract saga information, providing real-time insights into service involvement.

**Sysops Squad Saga: Atomic Transactions and Compensating Updates:**

In a microservices architecture, marking a ticket complete involves a series of synchronous and asynchronous operations. The workflow includes updating the ticket status, sending ticket analytics, and preparing customer surveys. These operations demonstrate the complexity and coordination required in managing transactional sagas effectively.

Overall, the choice of saga pattern and management technique depends on the specific requirements of scalability, complexity, and coordination within a distributed system. Each pattern offers distinct trade-offs, influencing the architecture's responsiveness and consistency. 



### Summary of Distributed Transaction Challenges and Solutions

The text discusses the complexities and challenges associated with distributed transactions, particularly focusing on the Sysops Squad's ticket management workflow. Key points include the difficulties of compensating updates, lack of transactional isolation, and issues with responsiveness.

#### Workflow Overview
1. **Ticket Completion Process**: The Sysops Squad expert marks a ticket as complete, triggering a series of actions including sending a survey to the customer.
2. **Compensating Updates**: If a service like the Survey Service is unavailable, a compensating update may reverse the ticket's status from completed back to in-progress.

#### Challenges with Distributed Transactions
- **Lack of Isolation**: Distributed transactions do not support isolation, leading to potential side effects. For instance, data processed by one service might be used by another before a compensating update reverses it.
- **Compensation Failures**: Errors in compensating updates can lead to inconsistencies, such as a ticket being marked complete when it should be in-progress.
- **End-User Confusion**: Users may receive errors requiring them to retry actions, causing frustration and inefficiency.

#### Trade-Offs and Patterns
- **Atomic vs. Eventual Consistency**: Atomic transactions ensure data consistency but can be slow, while eventual consistency improves responsiveness by handling errors asynchronously.
- **Strict vs. Loose Contracts**: Strict contracts offer fidelity and versioning but are brittle. Loose contracts, like REST or GraphQL, provide flexibility and reduce coupling.
- **Alternative Patterns**: Patterns like Fairy Tale or Parallel Sagas use asynchronous processing to manage errors without involving the end-user, improving responsiveness.

#### Architectural Considerations
- **Service Coordination**: The mediator must handle service calls and potential conflicts, which can complicate asynchronous workflows.
- **Contract Management**: Deciding between strict and loose contracts impacts how services interact and evolve. Loose contracts, while offering flexibility, require careful management to avoid fragility.

#### Conclusion
The text underscores the importance of understanding the trade-offs in distributed architectures. It suggests that adopting patterns that rely on eventual consistency and state management can mitigate some of the issues associated with atomic transactions. By exploring alternative patterns, architects can design more resilient and responsive systems.

Balancing strict and loose contracts, consumer-driven approaches, and managing data effectively are crucial for microservice architectures. These decisions depend on team maturity, the need for flexibility, and the specific requirements of the system architecture.



# Summary of Data Management Patterns

## Data Warehouse Pattern

The Data Warehouse pattern is characterized by the extraction of data from multiple sources into a centralized warehouse for analytical purposes. This involves transforming operational data into a single schema, often using a Star Schema for dimensional modeling. Data is denormalized to enhance performance and simplify queries. Analysis is conducted within the warehouse, utilizing the storage and compute capabilities to offload operational systems. Data analysts use the warehouse to generate business intelligence reports and dashboards, typically through SQL-like interfaces.

### Advantages:
- Centralized data consolidation
- Dedicated analytics silo

### Disadvantages:
- Integration brittleness due to schema transformations
- Complexity and limited functionality
- Synchronization bottlenecks
- Operational versus analytical contract differences

## Data Lake Pattern

The Data Lake pattern emerged as a reaction to the complexity and limitations of the Data Warehouse. It uses a "load and transform" approach, storing data in its raw form, which can be transformed on demand by data scientists. This pattern is better suited for distributed architectures and machine learning applications but still maintains a centralized view of data.

### Advantages:
- Less structured than Data Warehouse
- Better suited to distributed architectures

### Disadvantages:
- Difficulty in discovering data relationships
- Potential privacy issues with PII data
- Still technically partitioned, not domain-focused

## Data Mesh Pattern

The Data Mesh pattern addresses the limitations of previous approaches by focusing on domain-oriented data ownership and decentralized management. It aligns data architecture with business domains, enabling peer-to-peer data consumption without centralized lakes or warehouses.

### Core Principles:
1. **Domain Ownership of Data**: Data is owned by the domains that generate or consume it, allowing distributed sharing without intermediaries.
2. **Data as a Product**: Encourages domains to provide data as a product, emphasizing discoverability, quality, and security.
3. **Self-Serve Data Platform**: Provides platform capabilities for easy creation and management of data products.
4. **Computational Federated Governance**: Ensures organization-wide governance through automated policies embedded in data products.

### Data Product Quantum

The Data Mesh introduces the concept of a data product quantum (DPQ), which is built alongside microservices. This approach ensures that data remains within its domain context, facilitating better integration and use across the organization.

The Data Mesh pattern offers a modern approach to managing analytical data, aligning with distributed architectures and addressing privacy concerns while promoting domain-focused data management.

For more comprehensive insights, refer to the book "Data Mesh" by Zhamak Dehghani.




### Summary of Data Product Quantum (DPQ) and Data Mesh Implementation

#### Structure of a Data Product Quantum (DPQ)

A Data Product Quantum (DPQ) is a crucial component in modern data architectures, acting as an interface for analytics and reporting. It is operationally independent yet highly coupled with both behavior and transactional data. DPQs come in various forms:

- **Source-aligned DPQ**: Provides analytical data for a microservice, acting as a cooperative quantum.
- **Aggregate DPQ**: Collects data from multiple inputs, either synchronously or asynchronously.
- **Fit-for-purpose DPQ**: Custom-built to meet specific analytical or business intelligence needs.

Each DPQ is managed by the domain team responsible for the service it complements. It overlaps with database information and interacts asynchronously with domain behavior, providing analytics and business intelligence capabilities.

#### Cooperative Quantum and Data Mesh

A Cooperative Quantum is operationally separate but tightly coupled with its cooperator via asynchronous communication and eventual consistency. It manages the separation between operational and analytical data. The analytical quantum relies on static coupling to individual DPQs for information, using synchronous or asynchronous calls as needed.

#### Data Mesh Pattern

The Data Mesh pattern supports microservices architectures, allowing excellent decoupling between analytical and operational data. It enables domain teams to control data consumption, cadence, quality, and transparency. However, it requires careful contract coordination and is challenging in architectures needing constant data synchronization.

#### Sysops Squad Saga: Data Mesh Implementation

The Sysops Squad team is implementing a data mesh to become data-driven in expert supply planning. Each new service includes a DPQ, managed by the domain team. The platform team provides self-serve capabilities, allowing teams to build new analytical use cases by connecting to existing DPQs. A global federated governance group standardizes aspects like data-sharing contracts and access control.

#### Expert Supply DPQ

To address expert supply needs, the team plans to create an "Experts Supply DPQ," aggregating data from tickets, user maintenance, and surveys. It will provide daily recommendations using a machine learning model. The design ensures complete data snapshots to avoid skewing trend analysis.

#### Trade-Off Analysis in Distributed Architectures

The team emphasizes the importance of trade-off analysis, focusing on coupling and communication within architectures. A three-step process involves identifying entangled dimensions, analyzing coupling, and assessing trade-offs. Static coupling diagrams help visualize dependencies, while dynamic coupling considers workflow communication.

#### Conclusion

The implementation of data mesh and DPQs allows for incremental evolution in software architecture, addressing past challenges of domain and data separation. Continuous collaboration and disciplined trade-off analysis are key to maintaining progress and avoiding previous pitfalls.



In the analysis of trade-offs in software architecture, key concerns include coupling, complexity, responsiveness/availability, and scale/elasticity. These are evaluated alongside communication, consistency, and coordination. The "Parallel Saga" pattern, for example, is rated as having low coupling and complexity, but high responsiveness and scale. Analyzing these patterns independently and in a matrix reveals crucial insights, such as the inverse correlation between coupling and scalability—higher coupling generally reduces scalability and responsiveness due to increased service interdependencies.

Iterative architecture is essential for understanding complex systems. By building a matrix of possibilities, architects can explore the effects of varying different dimensions, facilitating better decision-making. This involves focusing on fundamental trade-offs like synchronous versus asynchronous communication, which influence subsequent choices. Iterative analysis helps architects tackle entangled dimensions, leading to effective design solutions.

Trade-off analysis should primarily be qualitative, as true quantitative comparisons are rare in architecture due to the uniqueness of each system. Architects are encouraged to develop qualitative analysis skills, using statistical analysis over large datasets to inform decisions. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) lists are recommended to ensure comprehensive and accurate comparisons, avoiding invalid comparisons between dissimilar entities.

Context is crucial in trade-off analysis. Decisions must be made within the relevant context to avoid skewed results. For instance, choosing between a shared service or library requires consideration of organizational needs and specific scenarios. By modeling relevant domain cases, architects can filter options and focus on significant trade-offs, such as performance versus extensibility.

Architects should prioritize key decision points over overwhelming evidence, simplifying complex information for nontechnical stakeholders. This approach helps stakeholders focus on outcomes rather than technical details. For example, when deciding between synchronous and asynchronous communication, architects should present the core advantages and disadvantages, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Evangelism and "snake oil" solutions can mislead architects. Enthusiasm for a particular technology may lead to biased assessments, ignoring trade-offs. Scenario analysis allows architects to test solutions iteratively, revealing potential pitfalls. By modeling scenarios, architects can determine the best approach based on specific requirements, avoiding the pitfalls of evangelism.

In summary, effective trade-off analysis in architecture involves iterative exploration, qualitative assessments, contextual understanding, and clear communication of key decision points. Architects should remain wary of biases and focus on modeling relevant scenarios to guide informed decision-making.
