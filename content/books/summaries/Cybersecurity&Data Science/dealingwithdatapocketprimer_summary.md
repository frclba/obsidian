## Perplexity

Perplexity is related to probability distributions, used in evaluating models like language models.

This summary encapsulates the essence of statistical methodologies, emphasizing clarity and precision in understanding and application.



## Summary

### Perplexity and Entropy

Perplexity is a measure related to the entropy of a model's probability distribution. It is calculated using the formula \( \text{PERP} = b^S \), where \( S = (-1/N) \times \sum \log q(x_i) \). This concept is crucial in evaluating language models in NLP, providing an estimate for the encoding size of a set of sentences.

### Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence

Cross-entropy and KL divergence are essential in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Cross-entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions \( P \) and \( Q \), defined as \( \text{CE}(Q,P) = \sum p_i \times (\log q_i - \log p_i) \). KL divergence is derived from cross-entropy and entropy, given by \( \text{KL}(P||Q) = \text{CE}(P,Q) - H(P) \). These concepts help in tasks like credit assignment problems.

### Covariance and Correlation Matrices

Covariance matrices capture the variance and covariance between variables. A covariance matrix \( C \) is symmetric, with diagonal entries representing variances. If the units of measure differ, a correlation matrix is preferred, calculated as \( \text{corr}(x,y) = \text{cov}(x,y)/(\text{std}_x \times \text{std}_y) \).

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are key in understanding data structures. For a matrix \( C \), eigenvalues are real numbers, and eigenvectors are vectors in a Euclidean space. A non-zero vector \( x' \) is an eigenvector if \( C \times x' = \lambda \times x' \). Eigenvectors are orthogonal, and their calculation involves solving \( \det(C - \lambda I) = 0 \).

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the most important features in a dataset. It involves calculating the correlation matrix, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and constructing a new matrix from these eigenvectors. The principal components are determined by the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, providing a variance-based measure of information. PCA is commonly used for preprocessing and reducing computation time in models.

### Practical Applications

### Data Preprocessing and Wrangling

Data preprocessing involves handling incorrect or missing values and calculating statistics like minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation for numeric features. After preprocessing, data wrangling transforms data into a new format, often combining data from multiple sources or converting units for consistency. Internationalization (i18n) and localization (L10n) play roles in handling currency and data values.

### Data Types in Machine Learning

Datasets in machine learning can contain diverse data types, including:
- **Numeric Data**: Integer/floating point, discrete/continuous.
- **Character/Categorical Data**: Different languages.
- **Date-Related Data**: Various formats.
- **Currency Data**: Different formats.
- **Binary Data**: Yes/no, 0/1.
- **Nominal Data**: Unrelated values.
- **Ordinal Data**: Related values.

For example, real estate datasets may include features like the number of bedrooms (numeric), city name (character), construction date (date), selling price (currency), and sale status (binary).

### Preparing Datasets

Data cleaning is simplified if datasets are in good condition. When combining datasets with different formats, conversion to a common format is necessary. Categorical data must be converted to numeric values for model training, such as mapping gender to 0 and 1.

### Discrete vs. Continuous Data

Discrete data can be counted, while continuous data is measured. Examples include provinces (discrete) and temperature (continuous). Continuous data may be treated as discrete when there are many possible values, like stock prices.

### Binning Continuous Data

Binning subdivides values into intervals, treating them as the same value, which can increase errors. Alternatives to binning should be considered, as it can misclassify similar values.

### Scaling Numeric Data

Scaling is essential, often using normalization or standardization:
- **Normalization**: Scales data to [0, 1] using formulas like \((x - \text{min})/(\text{max} - \text{min})\).
- **Standardization**: Involves mean (\(\mu\)) and standard deviation (\(\sigma\)), mapping each value to \((x - \mu)/\sigma\).

### Robust Standardization

Robust standardization uses values between the 25th and 75th percentiles, ignoring outliers, computed as \((X_i - X_M)/(X_{75} - X_{25})\).

### Handling Categorical Data

For categorical data, ensure consistent formats and handle inconsistencies like spelling errors. Convert categorical data to numeric values using techniques like:
- **Mapping**: Converting categories to integers.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts each category to a binary vector.

These methods facilitate model training by representing categorical data numerically.

### Considerations

When preparing data, ensure consistent data formats and handle categorical values appropriately. Choose scaling and conversion techniques based on the dataset and analysis requirements.




### Data Encoding and Handling

#### One-Hot Encoding
One-hot encoding transforms categorical data into a binary matrix representation. Each category is mapped to a vector in an identity matrix, which can increase dataset sparsity and lead to overfitting. Alternatives include mapping categories to integers or examining row frequency to categorize values efficiently.

#### Date and Currency Formatting
Data localization involves standardizing formats like dates and currency. Different countries use various formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY) and symbols in currency (e.g., 1,124.78 vs. 1.124,78). Consistent formatting is crucial for data integration, and currency exchange rates can affect calculations.

### Outliers and Anomalies

#### Definitions and Consequences
Outliers are abnormal values outside the normal range, potentially affecting model accuracy. Anomalies can have severe consequences, such as fraudulent transactions. Deciding how to handle them requires balancing data integrity and model accuracy.

#### Detection and Removal Techniques

- **Random Undersampling/Oversampling**: Adjusts class sizes by removing or duplicating samples.

### SMOTE
SMOTE synthesizes new samples by:
1. Selecting a random sample from the minority class.
2. Finding its k nearest neighbors.
3. Creating a line between the sample and a neighbor.
4. Generating new samples along this line.

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff
In machine learning:
- **Bias**: Error from incorrect assumptions, leading to underfitting.
- **Variance**: Sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set, leading to overfitting.
Balancing bias and variance is crucial for model accuracy.

### Types of Bias
- **Availability Bias**: Making rules based on exceptions.
- **Confirmation Bias**: Focusing on confirming data while ignoring contradictory information.
- **False Causality**: Incorrectly linking two events as cause and effect.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing a failing endeavor due to past investments.
- **Survivorship Bias**: Focusing only on successful cases while ignoring failures.

### Analyzing Classifiers
Techniques like LIME and ANOVA help analyze machine learning models:

# Summary

**Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** are essential for storing records of events, ranging from simple purchases to complex financial transactions. They use tables to store data, where each row represents a record with multiple attributes. A key feature of RDBMS is support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions, especially critical in financial systems.

For example, in a money transfer between bank accounts, both debiting and crediting must be treated as a single atomic transaction. If one step fails, the transaction is rolled back to prevent data inconsistency. However, atomic transactions might not be as crucial in non-financial systems, like event registrations or displaying web images.

**Normalization** is a process in RDBMS that reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity by organizing data into related tables. For instance, instead of duplicating customer information in every purchase order, a separate customers table can be maintained. This simplifies updates, like changing an address, and prevents data inconsistency.

Consider a website selling tools; it requires tables for customer details, purchase orders, line items, and item descriptions. For a purchase by a customer like John Smith, the process involves creating entries in these tables, linking them through unique identifiers (e.g., `cust_id`, `po_id`). This structure ensures that all related data can be efficiently accessed and managed.

The **customers table** includes attributes like `cust_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and address details, with `cust_id` serving as a unique key. The **purchase_orders table** links to customers via `cust_id` and includes attributes like `po_id` and `purchase_date`.

The **line_items table** records each item in a purchase order, identified by `line_id`, and includes `item_id` from the **item_desc table**, which details each product available for sale. This table might also include an `AVAILABLE` attribute to indicate product availability.

In summary, RDBMS is crucial for managing structured data with integrity and efficiency, particularly in scenarios requiring reliable transactions and minimal data redundancy. Normalization, while potentially impacting performance, provides significant benefits in maintaining data accuracy and consistency.



### Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing data in relational databases (RDBMS). It is used to retrieve and manipulate structured data. Key SQL operations include:

### Database Operations and SQL Techniques

#### Merging CSV Files
To integrate data from two separate CSV files into a single file for database import, use a tool like Pandas in Python. This involves reading both files into data frames, merging them, and saving the result as a new CSV file. Example code in Python demonstrates this process, showing how to read, merge, and write CSV files using Pandas.

#### Modifying Database Tables
- **Dropping Columns**: Use `ALTER TABLE mytable DROP COLUMN str_date;` to remove a column. Always back up the table first to prevent data loss.
- **Changing Data Types**: To change a column's data type, first update its values if necessary, then use `ALTER TABLE` to modify the type. For example, convert a decimal column to an integer using `ALTER TABLE people_ages CHANGE float_ages int_ages INT;`.

#### Referential Constraints
These constraints ensure data integrity by preventing invalid data entries. Common constraints include:
- **CHECK**: Validates data against a condition.
- **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value for a column.
- **FOREIGN KEY**: Links a column to another table's primary key.
- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each table row.
- **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are distinct.

#### Data Insertion and Manipulation
- **Inserting Data**: Use `INSERT INTO` statements to add data to tables. For bulk inserts, consider using a SQL script or loading data from CSV files.
- **Populating Tables from CSV**: Use `LOAD DATA INFILE` to import data directly from a CSV file. Be aware of potential errors related to the `secure_file_priv` setting in MySQL, which restricts file import locations.

#### SQL SELECT Statements
- **Basic Selection**: Use `SELECT * FROM table;` to retrieve all data from a table.
- **Conditional Selection**: Use `WHERE` clauses to filter results, and `LIMIT` to restrict the number of returned rows.

#### Handling Errors and Configuration
- **File Path Errors**: Ensure correct file paths and permissions when loading files into MySQL.
- **MySQL Configuration**: Adjust settings like `secure_file_priv` to enable file imports. This might require system-specific commands or configuration file edits.

#### Practical Example: Using Pandas for Data Merging
A Python script using Pandas can merge two CSV files by aligning columns and writing the merged data to a new file. This is useful for preparing data before importing it into a database.

#### SQL for Data Insertion
SQL scripts can automate data insertion into tables, which is efficient for handling large datasets. Scripts can be scheduled as cron jobs for regular execution.

In summary, the text provides a comprehensive guide to handling CSV data, modifying database tables, ensuring data integrity with constraints, and efficiently inserting and querying data using SQL.



# SQL Basics and Techniques

## SQL Queries

- **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves data from one or more tables. Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on conditions, e.g., `SELECT * FROM people WHERE fname = 'john';`.
- **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the result set by specified columns, e.g., `SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city;`.

## Handling Duplicates

- **DISTINCT Keyword**: Retrieves unique rows, eliminating duplicates, e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;`.
- **UNIQUE Keyword**: Functions similarly to DISTINCT, selecting rows without duplicates.

## Advanced SQL Concepts

- **EXISTS Keyword**: Checks for the existence of a value, e.g., `SELECT city, state FROM weather WHERE EXISTS (SELECT city FROM weather WHERE city = 'abc');`.
- **LIMIT Keyword**: Restricts the number of rows returned, e.g., `SELECT city, state FROM weather ORDER BY state, city LIMIT 3;`.

## Data Manipulation

- **DELETE Statement**: Removes rows from a table. Use conditions to specify which rows to delete, e.g., `DELETE FROM customers WHERE FNAME = 'John';`.
- **TRUNCATE Statement**: Efficiently deletes all rows from a table.
- **DROP Statement**: Deletes a table and its data.

## Creating and Managing Tables

- **Temporary Tables**: Created for intermediate data processing, e.g., `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS temp_cust AS (SELECT * FROM customers);`.
- **Permanent Table Copies**: Created without the TEMPORARY keyword for persistent data storage.

## Indexing in SQL

- **Purpose**: Indexes improve data retrieval speed by storing entries in a structured format.
- **Types of Indexes**:
  - **Unique Index**: Prevents duplicate values.
  - **Clustered Index**: Orders table rows based on key values.
  - **Invisible Indexes**: Not used by the query optimizer but kept updated.
- **Creating Indexes**: Can be defined during table creation or added later, e.g., `CREATE INDEX friend_lname_idx ON friend_table(lname);`.
- **Managing Indexes**: Includes enabling, disabling, and dropping indexes to optimize performance.

## Performance Considerations

- **Index Overhead**: Indexes consume memory and can affect performance during data updates.
- **Optimal Indexing**: Define indexes on columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, or `JOIN` clauses.
- **Data Insertion Tips**: Consider disabling indexes before bulk inserts and re-enabling them afterward to improve performance.

## Best Practices

- **Multirow Insert**: Reduces index update frequency by inserting multiple rows in a single statement.
- **Column Order in Indexes**: Ensure the left-leading column in multicolumn indexes is referenced in queries.
- **Index Selection**: Use indexes for attributes in the `WHERE` clause to improve query efficiency.

By understanding these SQL concepts and techniques, you can effectively manage and optimize database operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.



### Summary of SQL and MySQL Operations

#### Indexing in SQL
Indexes improve read operation performance by reducing the number of comparisons needed during a search. For instance, a table with 1,024 rows might require 512 comparisons in a full scan but only about 10 with an index. However, indexes consume memory and must be updated after write operations, which can affect performance. It's crucial to experiment and profile systems to find the optimal number and type of indexes, possibly using SQL monitoring tools for optimization.

#### Finding Indexes in MySQL
To identify columns included in indexes in MySQL, use:
- `SHOW INDEX FROM people;`
- Query the `STATISTICS` table in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.

#### Exporting Data from MySQL
Data export can be performed via SQL queries, exporting result sets in formats like CSV, TSV, XML, HTML, JSON, and Excel. Databases can be exported entirely, structurally, or both, using tools like `mysqldump` or SQL Workbench for a GUI interface.

#### Loading Data in MySQL
To load data from a CSV file into a MySQL table, use the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command, specifying delimiters and line terminators. This is useful for importing large datasets.

#### Data Cleaning in SQL
Data cleaning tasks in SQL include:
- **Replacing NULLs**: Use `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to replace NULLs with specific values or averages.
- **Coalescing Values**: Use SQL updates to unify multiple representations of a value (e.g., different forms of "yes" to "Y").
- **Handling Data Type Mismatches**: Use `CAST()` to convert data types for operations like JOINs.
- **Converting Strings to Dates**: Use the `DATE()` function to transform string-based dates to date types in SQL.

#### Data Cleaning with Command Line Tools
Unix-based tools like `sed` and `awk` can perform data cleaning tasks such as replacing multiple delimiters with a single one or ensuring consistent column counts across rows. These operations are typically performed before processing data in tools like Pandas.

#### Example Scripts
- **Replacing Delimiters**: Use `sed` to replace delimiters in text files, simplifying data preparation for further processing.

This guide provides an overview of effective techniques for managing and optimizing SQL and MySQL operations, enhancing both data retrieval and manipulation processes.

The text emphasizes the importance of preprocessing in NLP and provides insights into using Unix commands for text manipulation. It also highlights the flexibility and power of SQL in managing data and the necessity of tailoring NLP techniques to specific tasks and datasets.



### Stemming and Lemmatization

**Stemming** involves reducing words to their root form by "chopping off" endings, often using rule-based algorithms. It is simpler than lemmatization and focuses on speed rather than accuracy. Common stemmers include the Porter, Lancaster, and Snowball stemmers. Stemming can result in over-stemming (too much truncation) or under-stemming (insufficient truncation), which may lead to inaccuracies.

**Lemmatization** determines the base form of a word, using the WordNet database and considering parts of speech. It is more accurate but computationally expensive compared to stemming. Lemmatization is better for verb tenses and irregular verbs, producing actual words as lemmas.

### Challenges and Limitations

Both techniques aim for recall over precision and may not work well with non-Indo-European languages like Chinese, where character combinations have distinct meanings. Stemming and lemmatization can differ significantly in non-English languages.

### Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging

POS tagging identifies grammatical functions of words in sentences, such as nouns and verbs. Techniques include deep learning (RNNs, LSTMs), lexical-based, probabilistic, and rule-based methods. POS tagging aids in creating parse trees and defining named entities.

### Data Cleaning with Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can clean data by matching patterns, such as:

- `[A-Z]`: Matches any uppercase letter.
- `[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter.
- `[^a-zA-Z]`: Matches non-letter symbols.

Examples include removing unwanted symbols, HTML tags, and contractions from text strings.

### Cleaning Data with Libraries

The `cleantext` library can clean text by removing symbols, URLs, numbers, and punctuation. It can translate characters (e.g., Hiragana to Romaji) but may not be fully accurate. Another library, `textcleaner`, offers similar functionalities.

### Handling Contractions

The `contractions` library expands English contractions and allows custom expansion rules. It can be installed via pip and provides a straightforward way to handle contracted forms in text.

### Conclusion

Stemming and lemmatization are essential for text normalization, each with its advantages and limitations. POS tagging and data cleaning techniques like regular expressions and specialized libraries enhance text processing capabilities, ensuring cleaner and more meaningful data for analysis.
