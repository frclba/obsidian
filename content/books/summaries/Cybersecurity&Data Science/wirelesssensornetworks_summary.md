Theorem 2 extends this to \(k\)-coverage and \(k\)-connectivity, providing fault tolerance by enabling monitoring as long as fewer than \(k-1\) sensors fail. Variations exist where sensors communicate directly with a base station or are mobile for self-deployment.

#### Maximizing Coverage Lifetime
In challenging environments, numerous sensors may be deployed, but they become inoperable once energy depletes. The network's life ends when it no longer covers all targets. Redundant sensors can be put to sleep to conserve energy, waking when needed. Protocols allow sensors to self-schedule, deciding when to sleep based on neighbor coverage, using a backoff scheme to prevent blind spots.

#### Routing in WSNs
Routing must be energy-efficient due to the difficulty of replenishing sensors' energy. Strategies include unicast, broadcast, and multicast, focusing on maximizing lifespan or network capacity. Unicast involves selecting paths that balance energy consumption and residual energy. Multicast and broadcast leverage the wireless broadcast advantage, using algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s to optimize energy use.

Redundancy enhances reliability by using multiple sensors to monitor the same point. Sensor fusion processes these measurements to determine the correct value or range, accounting for potential faults.

#### Routing Protocols
WSNs require efficient routing to transmit data to a sink, considering power, storage, energy, and processing constraints. Protocols are categorized as hierarchical, location-based, or data-centric. Data-centric protocols use queries and attribute-based naming to reduce redundant transmissions. Hierarchical protocols use clustering to save energy, while location-based protocols utilize positioning information to direct data.

#### Data-Centric Protocols
Data-centric routing involves sending queries to specific regions. SPIN (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation) uses data advertisement to exchange meta-data, reducing redundancy. Classical methods like flooding and gossiping relay data without predefined routes, with flooding broadcasting to all neighbors and gossiping selecting random neighbors.

In summary, WSNs require careful design to balance coverage, connectivity, energy conservation, and efficient data routing to ensure network longevity and functionality.

# Summary of Wireless Sensor Network Security

## Message Encryption and Trusted Paths

In wireless sensor networks, messages are encrypted using shared keys among trusted neighbors. Each trusted node adds its location for return messages and forwards the message to the neighbor closest to the destination. Once the message reaches its destination, the recipient can authenticate the source using a MAC. Replies follow the same trusted path.

## Wormhole Attack and Defense

A wormhole attack involves malicious nodes eavesdropping and tunneling packets to mislead the network. Defending against this involves using visualization techniques to identify and remove nodes causing distortions in the network's virtual layout, which appear as bends or curves.
