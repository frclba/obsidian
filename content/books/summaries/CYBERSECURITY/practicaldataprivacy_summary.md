It begins by acknowledging contributors to the book and emphasizes the importance of privacy as a fundamental right. The author highlights how privacy intertwines with organizational strategy and acknowledges the support received from friends and colleagues.

## Data Governance and Privacy

Data governance is described as the management of data rights and responsibilities within organizations. It involves understanding who collects data, how it is collected, and what happens to it post-collection. The text explains that data governance is crucial for ensuring privacy and security, and it supports the implementation of privacy principles like "Privacy by Design."

### Key Concepts in Data Governance

1. **Data Lineage and Origin**: Understanding where data comes from, how it is processed, and its reliability is essential. This includes tracking data sources, transformations, and ensuring proper documentation.
   
2. **Privacy and Security**: Organizations must manage access to sensitive data and monitor for breaches. Privacy controls should be in place, and compliance with regulations like GDPR is necessary.

### Final Thoughts

The text encourages organizations to think holistically about data governance and privacy, ensuring that sensitive data is identified and protected appropriately. It also suggests that whistleblowing can be done responsibly by using privacy-preserving techniques.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of data governance and privacy, offering practical insights into managing sensitive data within organizations.



In managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), it is crucial to acknowledge that PII discovery is inherently imperfect. Organizations should treat human-input data as highly sensitive, involving risk teams to address associated risks. Open-source tools like Microsoft’s Presidio can aid in PII discovery and pseudonymization, but a proactive approach involves tracking data from the point of collection, labeling it, and fostering a culture of documentation. This approach should engage various organizational departments, including security, IT, and data stakeholders.

Effective data governance relies heavily on comprehensive documentation, which includes classifying data to apply appropriate policies. Documentation should cover data collection, quality, security, privacy, definitions, and descriptive statistics. This practice not only facilitates cross-departmental collaboration and speeds up data experiments but also enhances compliance and reduces security risks. Data documentation should integrate with identity management systems to streamline access control and ensure responsible AI systems by documenting biases.

The documentation process should be user-focused, ensuring clarity and accessibility. It's vital to maintain accuracy to prevent misunderstandings that could lead to flawed decisions. Unknown or undocumented data, often accumulated over time, poses significant privacy and security risks. Organizations should establish processes to investigate, document, and make informed decisions about such data, including whether to delete, archive, or maintain it based on its sensitivity and utility.

To address unknown data, teams should investigate its provenance, determine its sensitivity, and create documentation for future reference. Decisions about the data should involve key stakeholders, ensuring compliance with privacy policies. Proper documentation and collaboration across data teams can minimize the presence of unknown data, promoting a more secure and efficient data environment.

Overall, the emphasis is on establishing robust documentation practices as part of data governance to enable effective data management, compliance, and innovation within organizations.



Data governance and privacy are crucial in managing modern data systems. Many organizations rely on outdated practices, such as using spreadsheets and undocumented data sources, which can lead to security issues due to shadow IT. Shadow IT refers to unauthorized data processes that bypass official IT systems, often leading to data being copied to multiple locations. This creates security risks and complicates auditing. A key role for data professionals is to replace these practices with transparent, documented, and privacy-preserving systems.

Data lineage, or provenance, is essential for understanding data's origin, transformations, and usage. It helps data scientists assess data quality and utility by answering questions about data collection, consent, and processing history. Despite its importance, many companies lack lineage tracking due to legacy systems focused on data storage rather than tracing. Implementing lineage tracking using tools like Apache Spark or data catalogs can improve data governance and compliance with data sovereignty laws, which require data to be stored within specific jurisdictions.

Data version control is another critical aspect, allowing organizations to track changes in datasets over time, similar to code version control systems like Git. This practice is vital for diagnosing issues in data models and ensuring data privacy. Versioning helps identify when data changes occur, aiding in debugging and maintaining data integrity. Selecting appropriate tools for data versioning involves evaluating their ability to manage snapshots efficiently and integrate with existing workflows.

Privacy techniques, such as pseudonymization, are important for protecting personal data. Pseudonymization involves replacing real data with pseudonyms, using methods like masking, tokenization, hashing, or format-preserving encryption. Each approach varies in privacy and data quality impacts. For instance, hashing makes data less interpretable but still linkable, while masking can remove identifiable information. The choice of technique depends on the specific privacy requirements and the potential for data linkage, a common vector for privacy breaches.

In summary, effective data governance involves documenting and managing data lineage, implementing version control, and applying privacy techniques like pseudonymization. These practices enhance data security, compliance, and usability, ensuring responsible data management in an evolving technological landscape.



### Summary

The text discusses pseudonymization and its role in privacy protection, particularly in the context of data governance and privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL). Pseudonymization retains the ability to link data while masking personal identifiers, but it is not equivalent to anonymization. Re-identification through linkage attacks remains a significant risk, especially as more data becomes available. Pseudonymization can create a false sense of security, leading to misconceptions that data is anonymized when it's not.

Pseudonymization is beneficial for internal use cases where data needs to be linked but not fully exposed, such as in business intelligence dashboards or customer support systems. It is also used to extract data for testing environments, though this carries risks due to weak protections in such settings. Alternatives like synthetic data generation are recommended for testing purposes.

Several tools and libraries support pseudonymization, including Hashicorp Vault, which uses format-preserving encryption, and open-source options like KIProtect’s Kodex and Microsoft’s Presidio. These tools help manage sensitive data securely, especially in microservice setups.

The text transitions into a discussion on anonymization, emphasizing that true anonymization is challenging. Traditional methods like suppression and aggregation have been debunked. Cynthia Dwork's work on differential privacy highlights that any data release can lead to re-identification attacks, as auxiliary information (existing or future knowledge) complicates privacy guarantees.

Differential privacy shifts the focus from guaranteeing anonymity to measuring privacy loss. It introduces a gradient of privacy, balancing information utility with privacy protection. The concept involves setting bounds on privacy loss using algorithms that add noise to data queries, ensuring individual privacy while allowing data analysis.

Differential privacy is defined by comparing two databases differing by one row, ensuring that the probability of identifying the presence of an individual is limited. This approach focuses on the process rather than the result, allowing for dynamic systems that adapt over time while maintaining privacy guarantees.

In summary, pseudonymization and differential privacy offer different approaches to data privacy. Pseudonymization is suitable for certain internal applications but lacks the robustness of anonymization. Differential privacy provides a scientific framework for quantifying privacy loss, balancing data utility with privacy through controlled data release processes.

The text concludes by encouraging a shift in perspective from binary privacy to a continuum, where various technologies offer different levels of privacy and information balance. Understanding these methods helps data scientists make informed decisions about privacy in their work.



### Understanding Differential Privacy

Differential privacy is a framework that helps protect individual privacy in datasets by adding noise to data queries, thus limiting the information gain of potential attackers. A key component is **epsilon (ε)**, which defines the privacy loss bound. A smaller epsilon indicates tighter privacy but potentially less accurate data.

#### Epsilon and Privacy Loss

Epsilon quantifies how much an attacker can infer about an individual from the dataset. For instance, if an attacker knows the average salary of a role and detects a change after a new joiner, they might estimate the new joiner's salary. Differential privacy limits such inference by bounding the information gain through epsilon.

Using **Bayes’ rule**, the attacker’s updated suspicion (posterior) is calculated based on their prior suspicion and the query response. The differential privacy formula is reformulated to show how epsilon influences the attacker’s certainty. Smaller epsilon values are recommended to keep privacy leakage minimal.

#### Implementing Differential Privacy

To achieve differential privacy, noise is added to the query results. This noise is sampled from specific distributions, like the **Laplace distribution**, which balances privacy and information accuracy. The noise ensures that the privacy loss remains within defined bounds, allowing for best, worst, and average-case privacy loss scenarios.

#### Guarantees and Limitations

Differential privacy provides probabilistic bounds on information gain, offering plausible deniability to individuals. However, it doesn’t guarantee zero privacy loss and isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. It’s effective for individual privacy but may not fully protect group information.

#### Practical Applications: The US Census

The US Census Bureau adopted differential privacy for the 2020 Census to protect individual data while maintaining data utility. They added noise to census data, ensuring accurate aggregate statistics while preventing re-identification attacks. This approach balances privacy and utility, crucial for tasks like federal funding and representation.

#### Challenges and Considerations

Using differential privacy can potentially undercount underrepresented groups, affecting federal funding and redistricting. It raises ethical questions about the trade-offs between privacy and representation, especially for vulnerable populations. Data scientists must consider these implications when deploying privacy mechanisms.

#### Legal and Technical Collaboration

Engagement with legal professionals is essential when handling personal data. Differential privacy is seen as a gold standard in privacy protection, but legal consultation remains crucial to ensure compliance and confidence in data release decisions.

#### Conclusion

Differential privacy offers a robust method for protecting individual privacy while allowing data analysis. By carefully choosing epsilon and implementing noise mechanisms like the Laplace distribution, organizations can achieve a balance between privacy and data utility. However, ongoing discussions about ethical implications and representation are vital in the deployment of such systems.


# Summary

Differential privacy ensures individual data protection by adding noise to query results. A common approach involves using the Laplace mechanism, which adds Laplace-distributed noise to maintain privacy. However, implementing differential privacy mechanisms from scratch is risky, as subtle bugs can negate privacy guarantees. It's recommended to rely on expert-audited systems.

### Naive Laplace Mechanism

A simple example uses a dataset of ages and salaries, demonstrating a naive Laplace mechanism in Python. The function adds noise based on an epsilon value, which determines the privacy guarantee. However, this naive implementation is insecure and should not be used in practice.

### Sensitivity and Error

Sensitivity measures the maximum change in query results when an individual's data is added or removed. It's crucial for maintaining privacy. For example, adding an 81-year-old to a dataset can significantly change the average age, revealing private information. Queries with unbounded sensitivity, like sums or minimum/maximum values, require special handling to prevent privacy breaches.

To manage sensitivity, one can introduce bounds, limiting possible query responses. This approach requires careful consideration of dataset characteristics, such as employee ages, to set reasonable bounds.

### Privacy Budgets and Composition

Differential privacy allows tracking and managing privacy loss through a concept called a privacy budget. The epsilon value represents privacy loss for a single query, and total privacy loss can be calculated by summing epsilons across multiple queries. This enables strategic allocation of privacy budgets, prioritizing more critical queries.

For example, calculating a differentially private average age requires separate queries for sum and count, each with its own epsilon. This involves clamping data to set bounds and adjusting the Laplace mechanism to incorporate sensitivity.

### Exploring Other Mechanisms

Besides the Laplace mechanism, Gaussian noise can also be used for differential privacy, offering a more familiar distribution for data scientists. This requires a relaxed definition of differential privacy, introducing a small delta to account for improbable outcomes. Choosing an appropriate delta is crucial to prevent unintended information leakage.

### Conclusion

Implementing differential privacy involves understanding sensitivity, managing privacy budgets, and selecting appropriate noise mechanisms. It's essential to use libraries that handle these complexities to minimize errors. Experimenting with toy examples and real datasets can help refine these techniques.


In the context of differential privacy, the Gaussian mechanism, traditionally used for \((\epsilon, \delta)\)-differential privacy with \(\epsilon < 1\), involves adding noise based on a Gaussian distribution. However, this method can introduce more noise than necessary. A refined approach, known as analytic Gaussian noise, is recommended, as detailed in Balle and Wang’s 2018 paper. This method uses a more complex formula, but for foundational understanding, simpler methods are initially discussed.

The Gaussian mechanism requires accounting for \(\delta\), unlike the Laplace mechanism, which satisfies \((\epsilon, 0)\)-differential privacy. Choosing a small \(\delta\) value, like \(10^{-5}\), is crucial as it provides more privacy guarantees. Sensitivity, representing the impact of a single individual's data, is central to both mechanisms. However, Gaussian noise is often preferred when sensitivity is high, as it scales with the square root of the number of statistics influenced by an individual, unlike Laplace noise, which scales linearly.

When applying differential privacy to datasets, such as those involving age and salary, Gaussian noise can be used to calculate means with privacy protection. The noise added by Gaussian mechanisms is normally distributed, making it suitable for scenarios where errors are assumed to be normally distributed. This property aligns well with linear algebra and machine learning tasks.

Differential privacy often results in data with higher error, necessitating intelligent use of results. Techniques like Bayesian reasoning and denoising methods can help reduce errors while maintaining privacy guarantees. Despite the noise, Gaussian mechanisms are advantageous due to their alignment with normal distribution properties.

In practice, understanding the trade-offs between Laplace and Gaussian noise is essential. Gaussian noise provides better performance in scenarios with high sensitivity and multiple statistics influenced by individuals. This understanding aids in making informed decisions about privacy mechanisms.

The text also touches on k-anonymity, an older anonymization technique, which groups individuals with similar attributes to prevent re-identification. However, it has limitations, such as potential exposure of sensitive data through homogeneous groupings. Enhancements like l-diversity were proposed to address these issues, but they introduced new challenges, such as data skewness and reduced utility.

Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate privacy mechanisms based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and the desired privacy guarantees.



# Summary

The text discusses the complexities of data anonymization and privacy, focusing on the limitations of k-anonymity and the advantages of differential privacy. It critiques k-anonymity for its inability to guarantee privacy, its need for customization, and the potential for bias, making it less recommended today. Differential privacy is highlighted as a rigorous method that provides provable privacy guarantees.

The text emphasizes integrating privacy into data pipelines, advocating for Privacy by Design. It outlines steps to incorporate privacy measures into data engineering workflows, stressing the importance of understanding data sensitivity, documenting risks, and outlining a privacy plan. It recommends starting small with measures like masking and redacting sensitive fields, and experimenting to find the right balance between data utility and privacy.

Key considerations include defining the purpose of data collection, maximizing privacy without losing utility, and expanding use cases as privacy measures prove effective. It suggests an agile approach, rolling out small changes and learning from each implementation. Regular communication with data consumers is crucial to ensure privacy measures meet their needs and adapt to changes in data or requirements.

The text also highlights the importance of meeting users where they are, minimizing disruption to their workflows while integrating privacy technologies. It encourages creating small software packages or using existing tools that support privacy functions, such as Apache Beam or Tumult Analytics.

Testing and verifying data pipelines is essential. Tools like Great Expectations can validate that privacy measures are working as intended, checking for the presence or absence of fields, correct application of privacy transformations, and expected data formats.

An example of a data sharing workflow is provided, illustrating how to share data securely while maintaining user privacy. The example involves a sustainable chocolate company using purchase data to measure marketing campaign effectiveness. The plan includes removing personal identifiers, retaining relevant campaign information, and aggregating order data while bounding outliers.

Overall, the text advocates for a forward-looking approach to data privacy, leveraging new technologies and continuously adapting privacy measures to fit organizational needs and compliance standards.



The text outlines a process for integrating privacy and data governance into data pipelines, emphasizing the use of secure methods and privacy frameworks. Key steps include merging data frames securely, encrypting user IDs, and aggregating data while removing outliers. The Great Expectations library is recommended for testing data pipelines to ensure they work correctly, with guidelines on setting up expectations, saving them, and using them as part of the data processing pipeline.

The text discusses the importance of consent and data provenance in data collection, suggesting that privacy-first defaults be implemented. It recommends designing user interfaces that allow users to manage their consent settings easily and outlines the need for retaining consent data to comply with regulations like GDPR. A schema is provided for tracking consent data using Apache Avro syntax, ensuring data is properly collected and stored.

Differential privacy is introduced as a method for anonymizing data in pipelines. Libraries like Tumult Analytics and PipelineDP are suggested for integrating differential privacy into existing workflows. The text provides examples of using these libraries to perform differentially private queries, emphasizing the need to manage privacy budgets effectively.

The text also discusses strategies for data access and privacy, such as restricting access to differentially private queries or using differential privacy in third-party data sharing. It advises experimenting with different approaches to find what works best for an organization, balancing data protection with the need for data analysis.

Overall, the text highlights the importance of implementing robust privacy measures in data pipelines, using modern tools and frameworks to ensure data is collected, processed, and shared securely and ethically.



Apple and Google have pioneered privacy techniques for data collection, focusing on differential privacy to protect user data. Apple implemented local differential privacy for emoji suggestions on iOS, ensuring data is anonymized before reaching their servers. This involves adding noise to the data on the user's device, dropping IP addresses, and aggregating results for analysis. Trust boundaries are crucial, marking security changes and ensuring privacy guarantees aren't violated.

Google's RAPPOR, launched in 2014, was an early attempt at differential privacy for Chrome, using randomized response to collect sensitive data. However, it was discontinued due to high error rates and the complexity of achieving accurate results with local differential privacy. Google's later Prochlo method combined local and central differential privacy, relying on trust boundaries and encryption.

For effective privacy engineering, organizations need clear communication between data science and engineering teams. Data governance involves shared responsibilities, with data scientists defining problems and data engineers managing workflows. Privacy documentation should be integrated into code repositories, and organizations should foster a culture of privacy, aligning it with business goals.

Privacy as a core value can enhance trust and brand reputation, benefiting both consumer-facing and B2B companies. Building a privacy-focused culture requires ongoing effort, similar to security practices, with champions advocating for privacy integration across the organization.



## Summary

### Building Privacy into Data Pipelines

Incorporating privacy into data workflows requires collaboration with security experts to integrate privacy advocacy into educational efforts. This ensures that privacy considerations are addressed before deployment. Automating privacy in data pipelines involves analyzing system needs and implementing privacy technologies like differential privacy, which can be integrated into systems like Spark. Collaboration across teams is crucial to foster privacy awareness.

### Privacy Attacks

Understanding privacy attacks involves thinking like both a security analyst and an attacker. This cyclical approach requires envisioning potential threats and continuously updating protections as threats evolve. Analyzing common attack vectors helps in planning proactive defenses.

#### Netflix Prize Attack

The Netflix Prize competition in 2007 exposed user data vulnerabilities. Researchers Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov demonstrated that supposedly anonymized data could be de-anonymized by matching Netflix viewing data with IMDB profiles. This highlighted the risks of linkage attacks, where auxiliary data sources are used to re-identify individuals.

#### Linkage Attacks

Linkage attacks involve combining data from multiple sources to re-identify individuals. Protecting against these requires considering both public and private datasets that could be linked. Implementing state-of-the-art privacy protections, like differential privacy, is crucial for data shared publicly or with third parties.

#### Singling Out Attacks

Singling out attacks target individuals within datasets. For instance, querying a naively anonymized database can reveal personal information if proper protections are not in place. The NYC taxi dataset incident exemplifies how poor anonymization can lead to re-identification of individuals, including celebrities.

#### Strava Heat Map Attack

In 2018, Strava's global activity map inadvertently revealed secret military bases due to a lack of users in certain regions, demonstrating how even aggregated data can leak sensitive information.

### Conclusion

The responsibility of data holders is akin to public infrastructure builders—protections must exist for everyone. Proper governance and documentation are essential to prevent re-identification and ensure privacy. Continuous evaluation of potential attack vectors and implementing robust privacy measures are necessary to safeguard sensitive data.



The release of Strava's global heat map inadvertently exposed sensitive military data, highlighting privacy risks when individual data reveals group information. This incident demonstrated the interplay between individual and group privacy, where personal data can inadvertently expose confidential information about military bases and operations. The incident underscores the importance of Privacy by Design principles, emphasizing the need for safe defaults and consent options.

In another case, aggregated data collected internally at Google revealed salary disparities between male and female employees. This data was used as evidence in a lawsuit, illustrating how data analysis can expose inequality and inform diversity initiatives. However, group privacy can sometimes be undesirable when decisions are based on private attributes.

Membership inference attacks pose another privacy threat. These attacks determine if an individual's data was used to train a model, which can reveal sensitive information about the person, especially if the dataset is small or the individual is an outlier. Reza Shokri's work on these attacks demonstrated how shadow models and discriminators can identify training data membership, revealing the importance of models that generalize well.

Attribute privacy attacks extend this concept by inferring group attributes from training data, potentially leaking sensitive group details. This is particularly concerning when models are trained on small, targeted populations. The research also highlights how seemingly innocuous data, like social media likes, can reveal private attributes, emphasizing the need for careful data handling.

Model memorization is another issue, where models inadvertently store sensitive information, particularly for outliers. Large models are prone to overfitting and memorization, as demonstrated in research on language models and GANs. This memorization can lead to privacy breaches, as seen in cases where synthetic data was traceable to original datasets.

Model-stealing attacks are a growing threat as models become valuable assets integrated into production systems. These attacks involve replicating models by optimizing API requests to span the input data space. The theft of models containing sensitive or proprietary information poses significant risks, akin to stealing data or assets from an organization.

Overall, these examples illustrate the complex landscape of privacy attacks in data science and machine learning. They emphasize the need for robust privacy techniques and technologies to protect sensitive data and prevent information leakage.



# Summary

## Privacy and Security Challenges in Machine Learning

### Privacy Attacks

When deploying machine learning models to devices, users can inspect and reverse-engineer models, posing privacy risks. Protecting models on devices remains an open problem. Strategies include using differential privacy during training, obfuscating model architectures, or employing federated learning. Model inversion attacks can extract sensitive data, such as images from facial recognition systems, using only class labels and model access. High-value models require robust protection, balancing usability with security.

### Attacks on Privacy Protocols

Differential privacy mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks, such as those exploiting floating-point system predictability. For instance, Ilya Mironov's 2012 attack on Laplace distribution highlighted this vulnerability. To prevent such attacks, libraries should incorporate post-processing of random noise additions. Timing attacks also pose risks by analyzing response times to infer noise distribution, common in cryptographic operations.

### Data Security

Data security intersects with privacy and governance, focusing on the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Security measures like access control, data loss prevention, and additional security controls are vital. Access control systems manage data access, while data loss prevention technologies detect unauthorized data movements. Extra security measures, such as encryption and access restrictions, mitigate risks.

### Threat Modeling and Incident Response

Security professionals use threat modeling to anticipate malicious actions and incident response plans to address security breaches. These plans involve collaboration with various teams and require understanding potential risks and responses. Incident response is crucial, involving steps like evidence collection and remediation.

### Probabilistic Reasoning

Security involves assessing threats based on likelihood and impact, using probabilistic reasoning. There is no "average attacker," but understanding typical attacker behaviors can guide security measures.

Overall, maintaining privacy and security in machine learning involves a multifaceted approach, integrating technical strategies and collaborative efforts across teams.



In threat modeling, identifying attack vectors involves assessing both their value and likelihood. However, human reasoning about likelihood without data is often flawed, as shown in Douglas Hubbard's research, which highlights inconsistencies in expert risk assessments over time. This malleability in risk classification suggests current methods may not be reliable.

Traditional risk matrices, while popular, are often biased and uncertain. Data scientists can reduce this uncertainty through observation and experimentation, but only when historical data is available. In cases of high uncertainty and low information, their contribution is limited. The security community is moving towards more quantifiable risk scenarios, where data science can help model complex problems by identifying variables and using open data to assess their distribution over time.

Data-driven security experiments, like the research on Rowhammer, demonstrate the value of validating threats through modeling. For data science, managing risks involves securing data access, infrastructure, and models. Key mitigations include applying web security basics, such as OWASP's protective controls for API endpoints, and ensuring thorough testing of model endpoints. Adversarial and poisoning attacks require specific countermeasures, like rate limiting and input validation. Avoid direct public internet connections for models, and implement access control with identity verification.

Protecting machine learning models extends to securing the technological supply chain. Automation of workflows, designed with privacy and security in mind, is crucial. Questions to address include handling person-related data, understanding regulatory implications, and ensuring mitigations work through testing. Documentation and governance are essential for transparency and integration testing can ensure system functionality.

Staying informed about new attacks is vital. Conferences like DEFCON's AI Village and communities like OpenMined offer resources. Newsletters and blogs provide updates on privacy and security trends. Engaging with the community helps maintain awareness of relevant developments.

Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is a growing field that incorporates privacy-enhancing technologies into workflows. It aims to balance privacy and utility, improving generalization by preventing overfitting to private attributes. Techniques like differential privacy can be integrated into exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature preparation. A smaller group of data scientists can analyze data to determine appropriate privacy mechanisms, ensuring wider access through differential privacy or other protections.

In summary, understanding and mitigating privacy and security risks in data science involves collaboration, staying informed, and using privacy-preserving techniques. As the field evolves, continuous learning and adaptation are necessary to protect data and models effectively.



### Summary

In privacy-aware machine learning and data science, differential privacy is crucial, especially in text-based or natural language processing tasks.
