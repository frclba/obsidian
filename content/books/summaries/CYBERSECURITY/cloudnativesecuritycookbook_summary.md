GCP's VM Manager offers inventory, configuration, and patch management for virtual machines. Using Terraform, you can configure services like `containerscanning.googleapis.com` and `osconfig.googleapis.com` to manage VM inventories and configurations. A simple VM can be deployed using Terraform, and with the OS Config agent preinstalled, it will appear in inventory listings. GCP allows you to enforce package installations through OS policies, which are defined in YAML files and applied on a zone-by-zone basis.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS Systems Manager (SSM) manages EC2 instances at scale. It requires the SSM agent, an instance profile with permissions, and API access. Terraform can deploy EC2 instances with these configurations. SSM provides inventory data and allows package installations across instances using document associations like `AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory` and `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage`. Compliance is tracked and can be queried using AWS CLI commands.

### Microsoft Azure

Azure Automation manages fleets of VMs, supporting Windows and Linux, on-premises or in other clouds. VMs need extensions to report data to Log Analytics. Desired State Configuration (DSC) scripts manage package installations and compliance. Terraform can set up Linux VMs with DSC configurations. For Linux, Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) and DSC packages must be installed; for Windows, they are preinstalled.

### Patching at Scale on GCP

GCP's VM Manager offers a managed patching service. You can create patching plans targeting specific OS types using labels. The service supports multiple Linux distributions and Windows Server. Patching schedules can be customized, and pre- and post-patch scripts can be executed. VM Manager also provides vulnerability reports for known CVEs on machines.
